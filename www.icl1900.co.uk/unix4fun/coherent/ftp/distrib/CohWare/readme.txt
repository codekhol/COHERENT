CohWare are disk distributions of selected software, that
was ported to COHERENT by the user community or MWC. The
software also was available from mwcbbs and mirrors, as well
as ftp servers. In the 90th usage of analog modems was usual,
downloads were expensive with a low transfer rate and maybe
long distant calls. These floppy disks were another convenient
way to get interesting software for COHERENT.
