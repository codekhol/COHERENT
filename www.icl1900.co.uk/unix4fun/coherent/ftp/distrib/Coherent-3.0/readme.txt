Serial No. for installation: 127417124
This serial no. was used internally at MWC and doesn't belong to
anyone, so feel free to use.

The original COHERENT disk1 has a Y2K problem of course. If this disk
is used for installation the date will be 1970, causing problems.
The file coh300-1-y2k.dsk is disk1 with Y2K fixed 'date' command,
so better use this for an installation.
