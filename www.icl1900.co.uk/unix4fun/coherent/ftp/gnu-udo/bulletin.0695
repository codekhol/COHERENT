Here is the ASCII version of the latest GNU's Bulletin, which was
first distributed from the FSF Distribution Office.  This ASCII
version is essentially the same as the printed version except for
typography, a few graphics, a few corrections, and a few additions.

If you would like a hardcopy, send your request to the FSF address below
(including a small donation to cover copying costs is appreciated, but is not
required).  If you live in an area served by the US Post Office, please also
include either: your address on a mailing label and $0.55 in stamps; or a SASE
(Self-Addressed Stamped ($0.78) Number 10 or A5 sized Envelope).  If you're
from outside the USA, sending a mailing label rather than an envelope, and
enough International Reply Coupons for a package of about 100 grams is
appreciated but not required.  (Including a few extra International Reply
Coupons for copying costs is also appreciated.)

What Is the FSF?
****************

The Free Software Foundation is dedicated to eliminating restrictions on
people's right to use, copy, modify, and redistribute computer programs.  We
do this by promoting the development and use of free software.	Specifically,
we are putting together a complete, integrated software system named "GNU"
(pronounced "guh-new", "GNU's Not Unix") that will be upwardly compatible
with Unix.  Most parts of this system are already being used and distributed.

The word "free" in our name refers to freedom, not price.  You may or may not
pay money to get GNU software, but either way you have two specific freedoms
once you get it: first, the freedom to copy a program, and distribute it to
your friends and co-workers; and second, the freedom to change a program as
you wish, by having full access to source code.	 You can study the source and
learn how such programs are written.  You may then be able to port it,
improve it, and share your changes with others.	 If you redistribute GNU
software you may charge a distribution fee or give it away, so long as you
include the source code and the GPL; see *Note What Is Copyleft::, for
details.

Other organizations distribute whatever free software happens to be
available.  By contrast, the Free Software Foundation concentrates on the
development of new free software, working towards a GNU system complete
enough to eliminate the need to use a proprietary system.

Besides developing GNU, the FSF distributes GNU software and manuals for a
distribution fee, and accepts gifts (tax-deductible in the U.S.) to support
GNU development.  Most of the FSF's funds come from its distribution service.

The Board of the Foundation is: Richard M. Stallman, President;
Robert J. Chassell, Secretary/Treasurer; Gerald J. Sussman, Harold Abelson,
and Leonard H. Tower Jr., Directors.



What Is Copyleft?
*****************

The simplest way to make a program free is to put it in the public domain,
uncopyrighted.	But this permits proprietary modified versions, which deny
others the freedom to redistribute and modify; such versions undermine the
goal of giving freedom to *all* users.	To prevent this, "copyleft" uses
copyrights in a novel manner.  Typically, copyrights take away freedoms;
copyleft preserves them.  It is a legal instrument that requires those who
pass on a program to include the rights to use, modify, and redistribute the
code; the code and the freedoms become legally inseparable.

The copyleft used by the GNU Project is made from the combination of a
regular copyright notice and the "GNU General Public License" (GPL).  The GPL
is a copying license which basically says that you have the aforementioned
freedoms.  An alternate form, the "GNU Library General Public License"
(LGPL), applies to a few GNU libraries.	 This license permits linking the
libraries into proprietary executables under certain conditions.  The
appropriate license is included in each GNU source code distribution and in
many manuals.  Printed copies are available upon request.

We strongly encourage you to copyleft your programs and documentation, and we
have made it as simple as possible for you to do so.  The details on how to
apply either form of GNU Public License appear at the end of each license.



What Is the Hurd?
*****************

The Hurd will be the foundation of the GNU system.  It is a collection of
server processes that run on top of Mach, a free message-passing kernel
developed at CMU.  Mach's virtual memory management facilities are also used
by the Hurd.  The GNU C Library will provide the Unix system call interface,
using the Hurd servers for those services it can't provide itself.

One goal of the Hurd is to establish a framework for shared development and
maintenance.  The Hurd is like GNU Emacs in that it will allow users to
create and share useful projects without knowing much about the internal
workings of the system--projects that might never have been attempted without
freely available source, a well-designed interface, and a multiple server
design.

Currently, there are free ports of the Mach kernel to the 386 PC, the DEC
PMAX workstation, and several other machines, with more in progress,
including the Amiga, PA-RISC HP 700, & DEC Alpha-3000.	Contact us if you
want to help with one of these or start your own.  Porting the GNU Hurd & GNU
C Library is easy (easier than porting GNU Emacs, certainly easier than
porting the compiler) once a Mach port to a particular platform exists.
Right now we are using the University of Utah's Mach distribution which we
hope will be unified with the distribution produced by the Open Software
Foundation.

See *Note GNUs Flashes:: for a report on recent progress.

We need volunteers for significant projects relating to the Hurd.
Experienced system programmers who are interested should please send mail to
`gnu@prep.ai.mit.edu'.	Porting the Mach kernel or the GNU C Library to new
systems is another way to help development of the Hurd.



GNU Utilities Safer!
********************

Barton P. Miller & his colleagues tested the reliability of Unix utility
programs in 1990 & 1995.  Each time, GNU's utilities came out considerably
ahead.	They tested seven commercial Unix systems as well as GNU.  By
subjecting them to a random input stream, they could "crash (with core dump)
or hang (infinite loop) over 40% (in the worst case) of the basic utility
programs ..." They found that the commercial Unix systems had a failure rate
that ranged from 15% - 43%.  In contrast, the failure rate for GNU was only
7%.

For details, see the paper `Fuzz Revisited: A Re-examination of the
Reliability of Unix Utilities and Services' by Barton P. Miller, David Koski,
Cjin Pheow Lee, Vivekananda Maganty, Ravi Murthy, Ajitkumar Natarajan, and
Jeff Steidl, which is available on the World Wide Web at URL:
`ftp://grilled.cs.wisc.edu/technical_papers/fuzz-revisited.ps.Z'.



Conditions for Using Bison
**************************

As of Bison version 1.24, we have changed the distribution terms for
`yyparse' to permit using Bison's output in non-free programs.	Formerly,
Bison parsers could be used only in programs that were free software.

The other GNU tools, such as the GNU C compiler, have never had such a
requirement.  They could always be used for non-free software.	The reason
Bison was different was not due to a special policy decision; it resulted
from applying the usual General Public License to all of the Bison source
code.

The output of the Bison utility--a parser file--contains a verbatim copy of a
sizable piece of Bison: the code for the `yyparse' function.  (The actions
from your grammar are inserted into `yyparse' at one point, but the rest of
the function is not changed.)  When we applied the GPL terms to the code for
`yyparse', the effect was to restrict the use of Bison output to free
software.

We didn't change the terms because of sympathy for people who want to make
software proprietary.  *Software should be free.*  But we concluded that
limiting Bison's use to free software was doing little to encourage people to
make other software free.  So we decided to make the practical conditions for
using Bison match the practical conditions for using the other GNU tools.



GNUs Flashes
************

   * GNU Emacs 19.29	 (*Note GNU Software::)

     Emacs 19.29 has just been released.  Its new features include support for
     Windows NT, DEC Alphas, and Motif.

   * New Programs and Manual on the Tapes     (*Note GNU Software::)

     Texinfo source for the manual `Programming in Emacs Lisp: An
     Introduction' is now on the Lisps/Emacs Tape.  GNU Fortran (`g77'),
     `ncurses', & `ucblogo' are now on the *Note Languages Tape::.
     `cfengine', GIT, `mkisofs', `pine', & `saoimage' have been added to the
     *Note Utilities Tape::.

   * New Source Code CD!     (*Note June 1995 Source Code CD-ROM::)

     We are releasing the Sixth Edition of our Source Code CD-ROM.  It
     includes Emacs 19.29, and most of the new programs and changes on the
     tapes.

   * FlexFAX	 (Also *note GNU Software::.)

     Its author has renamed FlexFAX to HylaFAX due to a trademark conflict.

   * Older FSF CD-ROMs Available at a Reduced Price

     While supplies last, older versions of our CD-ROMs are available at a
     reduced price.  See the *note Free Software Foundation Order Form::.,
     for ordering information.

   * GNU Software Now Works on MS-DOS	  (Also *note GNU Software::.)

     GNU Emacs 19 and many other GNU programs have been ported to MS-DOS for
     i386, i486, & Pentium machines.  We ship binaries & sources on the *Note
     DJGPP Diskettes::, *Note Emacs Diskettes::, *Note Selected Utilities
     Diskettes::, the *Note Compiler Tools Binaries CD-ROM::, & soon on the
     *Note MS-DOS Book with CD-ROM::.

   * Postscript Versions of GNU Manuals Available for FTP

     FTP host `phi.sinica.edu.tw' has Postscript files (for A4 paper) of GNU
     manuals in `/pub/aspac/gnu/'.  The FSF is not responsible for these
     files.

   * Hurd     (Also *note What Is the Hurd::.)

     The GNU Hurd now runs programs native.  We have implemented both shared
     libraries using ELF, & the popular `ext2' file system used by Linux.  It
     can run GCC, `make', Emacs, & most other GNU utilities.  Progress is
     being made so rapidly that by the time you read this it probably does
     much more.	 It is right on the verge of being self-hosting (able to run
     on its own well enough to compile its own source code, & be used for its
     own development).	We have much better device supportm & some new
     utilities, including a fancy `ps' & `settrans'.   For a complete system
     we still have much more work to do, but we will make an alpha release as
     soon as the network software is finished & shared libraries have been
     well tested.  We have a mailing list to announce progress; to be added
     to it, ask `hurd-announce-request@prep.ai.mit.edu'.

   * Mach 4: a new research version of Mach

     Complete source and binaries for two versions of the Mach 4 kernel and
     related programs, part of an ongoing OS research project at the
     University of Utah, are available by anonymous FTP in
     `jaguar.cs.utah.edu:/flexmach'.

     One version is essentially a reorganization of CMU's Mach 3 (MK83a) and
     currently supports only the Intel x86 architecture.  Changes so far have
     increased Mach's ease of use & practicality in a PC environment.  These
     include a much simpler GNU-style build environment; a new kernel boot
     mechanism allowing booting using Linux, NetBSD, FreeBSD, or Mach boot
     loaders; compatibility with Linux network device drivers (& soon, Linux
     SCSI drivers); some new device drivers; & support for the "Lites"
     BSD-based single-server.  There are pre-built binaries for the kernel,
     Lites server, & the compiler tools to build Mach 4 under Linux, NetBSD,
     or FreeBSD.

     The other version supports only the PA-RISC 1.1 (HP 700) platform.	 It
     includes the new build environment, some early results of research on
     improving Mach RPC, as well as complete HP 700 support.  It is
     significantly less robust than the x86 version and should be considered
     an "alpha snapshot" for hard-core OS hackers only.	 The snapshot
     includes a complete 4.4BSD-Lite based single-server execution
     environment consisting of the Mach kernel, the "Lites" BSD-based
     single-server/emulator, a complete GNU compiler tool chain for the ELF
     object format, and essential 4.4-Lite utilities.

     Utah expects a major release by December 1995.  It will support both
     platforms, add more research results in the VM & RPC systems, add a
     programmable class server/linker/loader (OMOS), a powerful interface
     definition language compiler, & a portable distributed shared memory
     system.

     `http://www.cs.utah.edu/projects/flexmach/' contains more information on
     Mach 4 and related projects at the University of Utah, or send mail to
     `mach4-users-request@cs.utah.edu'.

   * The Dictionary Project

     The FSF has a copy of the unabridged `Century Dictionary', now in the
     public domain, and we are planning to put it online.  We tried OCR, but
     it wasn't reliable enough.	  The first group of dictionary volunteers
     have inputed some entries.	 We are evaluating their work to see how best
     to proceed.

   * Manuals Updated since Last Bulletin     (Also *note Documentation::.)

     These new editions includes bug fixes and additional information:
     `Debugging with GDB', `Emacs Manual', `GNU Emacs Lisp Reference Manual',
     `Texinfo Manual', and `C Library Reference Manual'.

   * GNU Column in Linux Magazine

     Arnold Robbins, `arnold@gnu.ai.mit.edu', a long-time volunteer for the
     GNU Project, writes "What's GNU?", a semi-regular column in the monthly
     magazine `Linux Journal'.	The column discusses the GNU Project, its
     software, and other interesting free software.  Authors of significant
     GNU software packages occasionally write columns as guest columnists.

   * Source CD-ROM Subscriptions

     We offer a subscription service for the Source Code CD-ROM in addition to
     our tape subscription service.  For the price of 3 CD-ROMs (plus any
     shipping costs) you get the next 4 that we make.  We make between two and
     four updates a year.  *Note Tape & CD-ROM Subscription Service::.

   * The FSF Takes Credit Cards

     We take these credit cards: Carte Blanche, Diner's Club, Mastercard, JCB,
     Visa, and American Express.  Please note that we are charged about 5% of
     an order's total amount in credit card processing fees.  Please consider
     paying by check instead or adding on a 5% donation to make up the
     difference.



Help from Free Software Companies
*********************************

When choosing a free software business, ask those you are considering how
much they do to assist free software development, e.g., by contributing money
to free software development or by writing free software improvements
themselves for general use.  By basing your decision partially on this
factor, you can help encourage those who profit from free software to
contribute to its growth.

Wingnut (SRA's special GNU support group) regularly donates a part of its
income to the FSF to support the development of new GNU programs.  Listing
them here is our way of thanking them.	Wingnut has made a pledge to donate
10% of their income to the FSF, and has purchased several Deluxe Distribution
packages in Japan.  Also see *Note Cygnus Matches Donations!::.

Free Software Redistributors Donate
***********************************

The Sun Users Group Deutschland and ASCII Corporation (Japan) have added
donations to the FSF to the price of their next CD-ROM of GNU software.	 The
producers of the SNOW 2.1 CD added the words "Includes $5 donation to the FSF"
to the front of their CD.  Potential buyers will know precisely how much of
the price is for the FSF and how much is for the redistributor.	 Austin Code
Works, a redistributor of free software, is supporting free software
development by giving the FSF 20% of the selling price for the GNU software
packages they produce and sell.	 Walnut Creek CDROM and Info Magic, two more
free software redistributors, are also giving us a percentage of their selling
price.	CQ Publishing made a large donation from the sales of their book about
GAWK in Japanese.

In the long run, the success of free software depends on how much new free
software people develop.  Free software distribution offers an opportunity to
raise funds for such development in an ethical way.  These redistributors
have made use of the opportunity.  Many others let it go to waste.

You can help promote free software development by convincing for-a-fee
redistributors to contribute--either by doing development themselves or by
donating to development organizations (the FSF and others).

The way to convince distributors to contribute is to demand and expect this
of them.  This means choosing among distributors partly by how much they give
to free software development.  Then you can show distributors they must
compete to be the one who gives the most.

To make this work, you must insist on numbers that you can compare, such as,
"We will give ten dollars to the Foobar project for each disk sold." A vague
commitment, such as "A portion of the profits is donated," doesn't give you a
basis for comparison.  Even a precise fraction "of the profits from this
disk" is not very meaningful, since creative accounting and unrelated
business decisions can greatly alter what fraction of the sales price counts
as profit.

Also, press developers for firm information about what kind of development
they do or support.  Some kinds make much more long-term difference than
others.	 For example, maintaining a separate version of a GNU program
contributes very little; maintaining a program on behalf of the GNU Project
contributes much.  Easy new ports contribute little, since someone else would
surely do them; difficult ports such as adding a new CPU to the GNU compiler
contribute more; major new features and programs contribute the most.

By establishing the idea that supporting further development is "the proper
thing to do" when distributing free software for a fee, we can assure a
steady flow of resources for making more free software.



Free Software Support
*********************

The Free Software Foundation does not provide technical support.  Our mission
is developing software, because that is the most time-efficient way to
increase what free software can do.  We leave it to others to earn a living
providing support.  We see programmers as providing a service, much as
doctors and lawyers now do; both medical and legal knowledge are freely
redistributable, but their practitioners charge for service.

The GNU Service Directory is a list of people who offer support and other
consulting services.  It is in the file `etc/SERVICE' in the GNU Emacs
distribution, `SERVICE' in the GCC distribution, and
`/pub/gnu/GNUinfo/SERVICE' on a GNU FTP host (listed in *Note How to Get GNU
Software::).  Contact us to get a copy or to be listed in it.  Those service
providers who share their income with the FSF are listed in *Note Help from
Free Software Companies::.

If you find a deficiency in any GNU software, we want to know.	We have many
Internet mailing lists for bug reports, announcements, and questions.  They
are also gatewayed into USENET news as the `gnu.*' newsgroups.	You can
request a list of the mailing lists from either address on page 1.

When we receive a bug report, we usually try to fix the problem.  While our
bug fixes may seem like individual assistance, they are not; they are part of
preparing a new improved version.  We may send you a patch for a bug so that
you can help us test the fix and ensure its quality.  If your bug report does
not evoke a solution from us, you may still get one from another user who
reads our bug report mailing lists.  Otherwise, use the Service Directory.

Please do not ask us to help you install software or learn how to use it--but
do tell us how an installation script fails or where documentation is unclear.

If you have no Internet access, you can get mail and USENET news via UUCP.
Contact a local UUCP site or a commercial UUCP site such as:

	UUNET Communications Services
	3060 Williams Drive
	Fairfax, VA   22031-4648
	USA

	Telephone: +1-800-4UUNET4
		   +1-703-206-5600
	Fax:	   +1-703-206-5601
	Electronic-Mail: `info@uunet.uu.net'

A list of commercial UUCP and Internet service providers is posted
periodically to USENET in the newsgroup `news.announce.newusers' with
`Subject: How to become a USENET site'.	 You can also get it via anonymous
FTP from the host `rtfm.mit.edu' in the file `How_to_become_a_USENET_site',
in the directory `/pub/usenet-by-group/news.announce.newusers'.

When choosing a service provider, ask those you are considering how much they
do to assist free software development, e.g., by contributing money to free
software development or by writing free software improvements themselves for
general use.  By basing your decision partially on this factor, you can
encourage those who profit from free software to contribute to its growth.



Postcards Only!
***************

CyberWire Dispatch points out that the United States government is continuing
its efforts to ban messages that it cannot read.

Such messages use various methods of encryption.  These methods are like a
traditional paper envelope in that they prevent an unintended person from
reading the message.  But they are more effective in that only the intended
recipient can `open the envelope', that is, decrypt the message and read it.
>From the point of view of the United States government, a ban on private
encryption would turn letters into postcards.

In a Congressional hearing on 11 May 1995, FBI Director Louis Freeh said,
"[W]e're in favor of strong encryption ... We just want to make sure we have
a trap door and key ...".

Freeh fears that crooks will use unbreakable methods of encryption for their
communications unless they are banned; but if these methods are banned, he
expects crooks will obligingly use the readable, government-provided methods.

Those who oppose a ban and favor non-governmental encryption point out that a
ban will be ineffective against such crooks.  The encryption software already
exists and is readily available.  The law-abiding will send messages that can
be read by the government; smart crooks will not.

As a practical matter, the FBI will have little choice but to focus on the
messages of law-abiding people who are carrying out actions that are legal
and patriotic, but unpopular.  This has happened in the past, and there is no
reason not to expect this to happen in the future.

If Freeh's hopes become law, non-governmental encryption will become illegal.
In the past, the government has favored its `Clipper chip', but a more
likely future plan would be for the government to certify several private
companies to provide legal encryption, but only for messages that people in
the government (and people who bribe them) can read.

We urge you to write your Senators and Representatives in Congress opposing
this attack on Americans' Constitutional right "to be secure in their
persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable search and
seizures ...".



Zimmermann Legal Defense Fund Appeal
************************************

Phil Zimmermann, who wrote the public-key encryption program known as Pretty
Good Privacy ("PGP") and released it on the Internet, is facing prosecution
for "exporting" it out of the United States.

There is a law prohibiting the export of encryption software from the US.
Zimmermann did not do this, but the U.S. government hopes to establish that
posting an encryption program on a BBS or on the Internet constitutes
exporting it--in effect, stretching export control into domestic censorship.
If the U.S. wins, that will have a chilling effect on the free flow of
information on the global network, as well as on everyone's privacy from
government snooping.

Estimates are that Zimmermann's defense will cost over $100,000--and that
doesn't even count lawyers' fees.  To help pay this, a legal trust fund, the
Philip Zimmermann Defense Fund (PZDF), has been established.  Donations are
accepted in any reliable form, check, money order, or wire transfer, and in

What Is the LPF?
****************

The League for Programming Freedom (LPF) aims to protect the freedom to write
software.  This freedom is threatened by "look-and-feel" interface copyright
lawsuits and by software patents.

The LPF is a grass-roots organization of professors, students, business
people, programmers, users, and even software companies dedicated to bringing
back the freedom to write programs.  The League is not opposed to the legal
system that Congress intended--copyright on individual programs.  The LPF
aims to reverse the recent changes made by judges in response to special
interests.

Membership dues in the League are $42 per year for programmers, managers, and
professionals; $10.50 for students; $21 for others.   To join, please send a
check and the following information:

   * Your name and phone numbers (home, work, or both).

   * The address to use for League mailings, a few each year (please indicate
     whether it is your home address or your work address).

   * The company you work for, and your position.

   * Your email address, so the League can contact you for political action.
     (If you don't want to be contacted for this, please say so, but please
     provide your email address anyway.)

   * Please mention anything about you which would enable your
     endorsement of the LPF to impress the public.

   * Please say whether you would like to help with LPF activities.

*The League is not connected with the Free Software Foundation, and is not
concerned with the issue of free software.*  The FSF supports the LPF
because, like any software developer smaller than IBM, it is endangered by
software patents, and interface copyrights.  You are in danger, too!  It
would be easy to ignore the problem until you or your employer is sued, but
it is more prudent to organize before that happens.

If you haven't made up your mind yet, write to LPF for more information:

News from the LPF
*****************

by Dean Anderson, President, League for Programming Freedom

Borland won its appeal of the Lotus suit!!  Lotus successfully sued Borland
for infringing on a copyright of its menu structure and may have stood to
gain $100 million dollars in a ruling issued in 1993.  This appeal reversed
that ruling.  Lotus has reportedly decided to file an appeal with the Supreme
Court.	The LPF is making arrangements to file a revised amicus brief should
the Supreme Court decide to hear the case.

This is outstanding news and a great victory for the LPF.  The arguments and
decision very closely match our position, and the amicus brief arranged by
the LPF was partly responsible for the outcome of the case.  If the decision
stands, it may spell the end of user interface copyrights.

The LPF is also happy to have received a *tremendous* amount of support on
the GIF issue.	This issue had the double benefit of expressing disapproval
of the Unisys patent, and gaining exposure and publicity for the LPF.

Qualcomm recently settled some protracted patent litigation with Interdigital
over CDMA technology.  (CDMA is a technology for cellular phones picked up by
Sprint, AT&T, etc.)  In 1993, Interdigital sued Qualcomm and was countersued.
After 10 trial days went by, the parties settled.

Even though Qualcomm felt it was not infringing any patents, it paid
Interdigital $5.5 million for a blanket license because continuing with the
trial and inevitable appeal would be more expensive, even if they eventually
won.

Qualcomm just released its earnings report.  It wrote off a one-time charge
of $13 million to cover the entire case.  By simple subtraction, its
litigation costs were $7.5 million.  Interdigital's own legal and support
costs were reportedly $4.5 million.  That leaves $1 million for their
shareholders and $12 million in litigation costs for the two companies.	 This
is just another example of the excessive costs of software patents.

Things are beginning to heat up.  Keep writing letters!	 Write the LPF, your
representatives, and others.  See our Web page at `http://www.lpf.org/' for
more info on how to help the LPF (suggestions to: `webmasters@lpf.org').



GNU & Other Free Software in Japan
**********************************

Mieko (`h-mieko@sra.co.jp') and Nobuyuki Hikichi (`hikichi@sra.co.jp')
continue to volunteer for the GNU Project in Japan.  They translate each
issue of this Bulletin into Japanese and distribute it widely, along with
their translation of the GNU General Public License Version 2.	This
translation of the GPL is authorized by the FSF and is available by anonymous
FTP from `ftp.sra.co.jp' in `/pub/gnu/local-fix/GPL2-j'.  They are working on
a formal translation of the GNU Library General Public License.	 They also
solicit donations and offer GNU software consulting.

`nepoch' (the Japanese version of Epoch) & MULE are available & widely used
in Japan.  MULE (the MULtilingual Enhancement of GNU Emacs) can handle many
character sets at once.	 Its features are being merged into the principal
version of Emacs.  *Note GNU Software::, for more details on MULE.  The FSF
does not distribute `nepoch', but MULE is available (*note June 1995 Source
Code CD-ROM::. & the *Note Emacs Diskettes::).	You can FTP it from
`sh.wide.ad.jp' in `/JAPAN/mule', or `etlport.etl.go.jp' in `/pub/mule'.

The Village Center, Inc. prints a Japanese translation of the `GNU Emacs Lisp
Reference Manual' and uploads the Texinfo source to various bulletin boards.
They have also published a copylefted book, Nobuyuki's and Mieko's `Think
GNU'.  This appears to be the first non-FSF copylefted publication in Japan.
Part of their profits are donated to the FSF.  Their address is:

The Institute for New Generation Computer Technology, ICOT, has released the
"ICOT Free Software (IFS)" distribution.  The famous Fifth Generation
Computing System project produced IFS, which includes 100 systems for symbol
processing, knowledge processing, problem solving, inference, & natural
language processing.  Many of them are based on parallel logic programming.
Nearly half of them run on Unix workstations.  The ICOT research center
closed in March 1995, but distribution & maintenance of IFS will continue.
For details, contact `ifs@icot.or.jp', or refer to `http://www.icot.or.jp/'.

There is a mailing list in Japan to discuss both hardware & software which is
under the GNU General Public License, providing information about making your
own computer system.  The main language of the list is Japanese.  If you are
interested in getting information or having discussions in English, ask
`mka@apricot.juice.or.jp' or `ishiz@muraoka.info.waseda.ac.jp'.

Many groups in Japan now distribute GNU software.  They include JUG, a PC
user group; ASCII, a periodical and book publisher; the Fujitsu FM Towns
users group; and SRA's special GNU support group, called Wingnut, who also
purchased the first Deluxe package in Japan.  (Since then, there have been
several other purchases of the Deluxe package in Japan.)

It is easy to place an order directly with the FSF from Japan, thus funding
new software.  To get an FSF Order Form written in Japanese, ask
`japan-fsf-orders@prep.ai.mit.edu'.  We encourage you to buy software on
tapes or CDs: for example, 140 CD-ROM orders at the corporate rate allows the
FSF to hire a programmer for a year to write more free software.



Freely Available Texts
**********************

Freely redistributable information isn't just software.	 We have a list of
groups providing various books, historical documents, and more.	 You can FTP
the list in file `/pub/gnu/FreelyAvailableTexts' from from a GNU FTP host
(listed in *Note How to Get GNU Software::).  Please let either address on
page 1 know of additional entries.

Help the GNU Translation Project
********************************

GNU is going international!  The GNU Translation Project will get
maintainers, translators, and users all together, so GNU will gradually speak
many native languages.	 The GNU `gettext' tool set contains *everything*
maintainers need for internationalizing their packages for messages.  It has
quite useful tools for helping translators add messages for their native
language, once a package has been internationalized.

To achieve the GNU Translation Project, we need many interested people who
like their own language and write it well, and who are also able to synergize
with other translators speaking the same language.  If you'd like to
volunteer to *work* at translating messages, please send mail to your
translating team.

These teams exist, as of May 1995: Chinese (zh), Czech (cs), Danish (da),
Dutch (nl), Esperanto (eo), Finnish (fi), French (fr), Irish (ga), German
(de), Greek (el), Italian (it), Japanese (ja), Indonesian (in), Norwegian
(no), Polish (pl), Portuguese (pt), Russian (ru), Spanish (es), Swedish (sv),
& Turkish (tr).	 Each team has its own mailing list, courtesy of Linux
International.	You may reach your translating team at the address
`XX@li.org', replacing XX by the two-letter ISO 639 code for your language.
Please note that language codes are *not* the same as country codes.  When
you become a member of the translating team for your own language, you may
subscribe to its list.	To subscribe, send a message with the message body
`subscribe' to the appropriate list.

Team members should be interested in *working* at translations or at solving
translational difficulties, rather than merely lurking around.	If you want
to start a new team, write `gnu-translation@prep.ai.mit.edu'.



GUILE
*****

The GNU Project continues to build GUILE: GNUs' Ubiquitous Extension
Language.  We are building a library which programmers can use to make any
ordinary C program extensible.	We expect to use this library in many GNU
programs and hope to see wide use elsewhere.

We are basing GUILE on SCM, a version of Scheme written by Aubrey Jaffer (see
the JACAL item in *Note GNU Software::).  The interpreter has been repackaged
as a C library.	 GUILE currently includes, with various degrees of
completion, a Posix system-call interface, an SCSH-like library, a module
system, a Tk interface, and a byte-code interpreter.  Projects are underway
to build into GUILE support for Emacs Lisp and for a more C-like language.

Since we want to encourage everyone to adopt a common interpreter, the
copyright terms for GUILE will permit the use of the library even in
proprietary programs.  Get snapshots of GUILE from `ftp.cygnus.com:pub/lord'.



Forthcoming GNUs
****************

Information about the current status of released GNU programs can be found in
*Note GNU Software::.  Here is some news of future plans.

   * GNU C Library     (For current status, *note GNU Software::..)

     While there has not been a new release of our C library since the January
     GNU's Bulletin, Roland has been doing lots of work on it, with a focus on
     support for the Hurd (*note What Is the Hurd::.).	Version 1.10 is in the
     works; it adds several new functions traditionally found in Unix systems
     and some small new GNU extensions.	 Ulrich Drepper has contributed to the
     library a great deal in the last few months, by writing new
     floating-point printing/reading functions that are perfectly accurate &
     much faster than the old code.  He has also written a whole set of
     internationalization features including POSIX.2-compatible `locale' &
     `localedef' programs & catalogs for displaying program messages in
     languages other than English.  The library can now be built as a shared
     library for the Hurd & other systems using the ELF object file format.
     Included is the run-time loader `ld.so' which sets up the shared
     libraries when a program runs; it works now on the Hurd and should be
     easy to port (using ELF) to GNU/Linux, SVR4 & Solaris 2.

   * GNUStep	 (Also see item Objective-C Library in *Note GNU Software::)

     OpenStep is an object-oriented application programming interface
     specification being proposed as an open object standard.  Since its
     announcement over two years ago, there has been much interest in a GNU
     implementation, named GNUStep.  Work has begun on GNUStep using an
     existing library written in Objective-C as a base.	 Much work remains to
     be done to bring this library close to the OpenStep specifications.
     Volunteers should contact `Paul_Kunz@slac.stanford.edu'.  Check
     `http://fvkma.tu-graz.ac.at/gnustep/gnustep.html' for more info.

   * `makeinfo' and the World Wide Web	   (Also *note GNU Software::.)

     `makeinfo' is being modified to translate Texinfo source files into HTML
     documents that can be displayed on the Internet's World Wide Web.

   * GNU Common Lisp	 (For current status, *note GNU Software::.)

     Version 2.0 of GNU Common Lisp (GCL) was released in April '95.  It now
     includes a graphical interface with the TK widget system.	All
     documentation is now Texinfo-based, with built-in regexp matching used
     to access the documentation.  A first pass at the Common Lisp condition
     system is also included.  Work on installing the new compiler and
     internals is underway, as well as a port to the DEC Alpha architecture.
     Volunteers for parts of the move to the ANSI standard are most welcome;
     contact `schelter@math.utexas.edu'.

   * GNU Emacs	   (For current status, *note GNU Software::.)

     Future versions of Emacs will provide: saving the undo history in a file,
     so you can undo older changes in the history, support for both
     variable-width fonts and wide character sets, and support for the
     world's major languages.  Our long term plan is to move it in the
     direction of a WYSIWYG word processor and make it easier for beginners
     to use.

   * C Interpreter

     We hope to add interpreter facilities to our compiler and debugger.  This
     task is partly finished.  GCC has generated byte code for all supported
     languages, but that support is in flux at this time.  A new effort to
     finish this work has begun. To make this work usable, we need to enhance
     GDB to load the byte code dynamically.  We also would like support for
     compiling just a specified few functions in a file.  Due to limited
     resources, the FSF cannot fund this.  Interested volunteers should
     contact `gnu@prep.ai.mit.edu'.

   * GCC     (For current status, *note GNU Software::.)

     New front ends for GCC are being developed for Pascal and Chill.  See the
     GNU Fortran and GNAT items in this article for news on those front ends.

   * GNAT: The GNU Ada Translator     *Not yet available from the FSF*

     A front end for much of Ada 95 (GNAT: The GNU Ada Translator) is
     available via anonymous FTP from `cs.nyu.edu' in `/pub/gnat'.  News about
     GNAT is posted to the USENET newsgroup `comp.lang.ada'.

   * GNU Fortran     (For info on `f2c' & GCC, *note GNU Software::.)

     The GNU Fortran (`g77') front end is stable, but work is needed to bring
     its overall packaging, feature set, and performance up to the levels the
     Fortran community expects.	 Tasks to be done include: writing
     documentation; improving diagnostics; speeding up compilation, especially
     for large initialized data tables; implementing `INTEGER*2',
     `INTEGER*8', and similar features; and arranging to build and install
     `libf2c' automatically.  We don't know when these things will be done,
     but hope some will be finished in the coming months.  You can speed
     progress by working on them or by offering funding.

     A mailing list exists for announcements about `g77'.  To subscribe, ask
     `info-gnu-fortran-request@prep.ai.mit.edu'.  To contact the developer of
     `g77' or get current status, write or finger `fortran@gnu.ai.mit.edu'.

   * Ghostscript     (For current status, *note GNU Software::.)

     Ghostscript 3.0 will be distributed by the FSF soon.  It will implement
     nearly the full Postscript Level 2 language except for LZW compression,
     which can't be freely implemented because of software patents.
     (Prohibitions on programming like this are what the League for
     Programming Freedom is fighting.  *Note What Is the LPF::, for details.)

   * `gmp'     (For current status, *note GNU Software::.)

     The GNU `mp' library, version 2.0, will have arbitrary multiple precision
     floating point arithmetic, be more portable, and be up to 4 times faster
     than previous versions.

   * Oleo     (For current status, *note GNU Software::.)

     Volunteers are writing an Oleo manual and extensions to the Oleo
     interface.

   * Smalltalk	   (For current status, *note GNU Software::.)

     The next release, version 1.2, will use the GNU Autoconf configuration.
     It will have significant performance improvements & memory requirement
     reductions, more control over the memory allocation, ability to use the
     Smalltalk interpreter as a subroutine (i.e., callable from C), better X
     Window System interfaces, ability to represent and manipulate C data
     structures in Smalltalk, conditional compilation facilities, large
     integer support, a complete GUI-based class browsing system, better (more
     complete/usable) TCP/IP interfaces, exception support, weak references, &
     finalization support.



GNU Software
************

All our software is available via FTP; see *Note How to Get GNU Software::.
We also offer software on various media and printed documentation:

   * *Note CD-ROMs::.

   * *Note Tapes::.

   * *Note MS-DOS Diskettes::.

   * *Note Documentation::, which includes manuals and reference cards.

In these articles describing the contents of each medium, the version number
listed after each program name was current when we published this Bulletin.
When you order a distribution tape, diskette, or newer CD-ROM, some of the
programs may be newer and therefore the version number higher.	See the *note
Free Software Foundation Order Form::., for ordering information.

Some of the contents of our tape and FTP distributions are compressed.	We
have software on our tapes and FTP sites to uncompress these files.  Due to
patent troubles with `compress', we use another compression program, `gzip'.
(Such prohibitions on software development are fought by the League for
Programming Freedom, *note What Is the LPF::., for details.)

GNU `make' is on several of our tapes because some system vendors supply no
`make' utility at all and some native `make' programs lack the `VPATH'
feature essential for using the GNU configure system to its full extent.  The
GNU `make' sources have a shell script to build `make' itself on such systems.

We welcome all bug reports and enhancements sent to the appropriate
electronic mailing list (*note Free Software Support::.).



Configuring GNU Software:
-------------------------

We are using a uniform scheme for configuring GNU software packages in order
to compile them.  It uses the Autoconf program (see item below, in this
article).  The goal is to have all GNU software support the same alternatives
for naming machine and system types.  When the GNU system is complete, it will
be possible to configure and build the entire system at once, eliminating the
need to separately configure each individual package.  You can also specify
both the host and target system to build cross-compilation tools.  Most GNU
programs now use Autoconf-generated configure scripts.

a reference card for that package.  To order them, see the *note Free
Software Foundation Order Form::..  *Note Documentation:: for more
information on the manuals.  Source code for each manual or reference card is
included with each package.

   * `acm'     (SrcCD, UtilT)

     `acm' is a LAN-oriented, multiplayer aerial combat simulation that runs
     under the X Window System.	 Players engage in air to air combat against
     one another using heat seeking missiles and cannons.  We are working on
     more accurate simulation of real airplane flight characteristics.

   * Autoconf	  (SrcCD, UtilT)

     Autoconf produces shell scripts which automatically configure source code
     packages.	These scripts adapt the packages to many kinds of Unix-like
     systems without manual user intervention.	Autoconf creates a script for
     a package from a template file which lists the operating system features
     which the package can use, in the form of `m4' macro calls.  Autoconf
     requires GNU `m4' to operate, but the resulting configure scripts it
     generates do not.

   * BASH     (SrcCD, UtilT)

     GNU's shell, BASH (Bourne Again SHell), is compatible with the Unix `sh'
     and offers many extensions found in `csh' and `ksh'.  BASH has job
     control, `csh'-style command history, command-line editing (with Emacs
     and `vi' modes built-in, and the ability to rebind keys) via the
     `readline' library.  BASH conforms to the POSIX 1003.2 shell
     specification.

   * `bc'     (DjgpD, DosBC, SrcCD, UtilT)

     `bc' is an interactive algebraic language with arbitrary precision
     numbers.  GNU `bc' follows the POSIX.2-1992 standard, with several
     extensions including multi-character variable names, an `else'
     statement, and full Boolean expressions.  The RPN calculator `dc' is now
     distributed as part of the same package, but GNU `bc' is not implemented
     as a `dc' preprocessor.

   * BFD     (BinCD, DjgpD, DosBC, LangT, SrcCD)

     The Binary File Descriptor library allows a program which operates on
     object files (e.g., `ld' or GDB) to support many different formats in a
     clean way.	 BFD provides a portable interface, so that only BFD needs to
     know the details of a particular format.  One result is that all
     programs using BFD will support formats such as a.out, COFF, and ELF.
     BFD comes with source for Texinfo documentation (not yet published on
     paper).   Presently BFD is not distributed separately; it is included
     with packages that use it.

   * Binutils	  (BinCD, DjgpD, DosBC, LangT, SrcCD)

     Binutils includes these programs: `ar', `c++filt', `demangle', `gas',
     `gprof', `ld', `nlmconv', `nm', `objcopy', `objdump', `ranlib', `size',
     `strings', & `strip'.

     Binutils Version 2 uses the BFD library.  GNU's linker `ld' emits
     source-line numbered error messages for multiply-defined symbols &
     undefined references, & interprets a superset of AT&T's Linker Command
     Language, which gives control over where segments are placed in memory.
     `nlmconv' converts object files into Novell NetWare Loadable Modules.
     `objdump' can disassemble code for a29k, ALPHA, H8/300, H8/500, HP-PA,
     i386, i960, m68k, m88k, MIPS, SH, SPARC & Z8000 CPUs, & can display other
     data (e.g., symbols & relocations) from any file format read by BFD.

   * Bison     (BinCD,DjgpD,DosBC,LangT,SrcCD,VMSCmpT)[FSFman,FSFrc]

     Bison is an upwardly compatible replacement for the parser generator
     `yacc'.  Texinfo source for the `Bison Manual' and reference card are
     included.	*Note Documentation::.	 A recent policy change allows
     non-free programs to use Bison-generated parsers. *Note GNUs Flashes::.

   * GNU C Library     (BinCD, LangT, SrcCD) [FSFman]

     The GNU C library supports ANSI C-1989, POSIX 1003.1-1990 and most of the
     functions in POSIX 1003.2-1992.  It is upwardly compatible with 4.4BSD
     and includes many System V functions, plus GNU extensions.

     The C Library performs many functions of the Unix system calls in the
     Hurd.  Mike Haertel has written a fast `malloc' which wastes less memory
     than the old GNU version.	The GNU regular-expression functions (`regex'
     and `rx') now nearly conform to the POSIX 1003.2 standard.

     GNU `stdio' lets you define new kinds of streams, just by writing a few
     C functions.  The `fmemopen' function uses this to open a stream on a
     string, which can grow as necessary.  You can define your own `printf'
     formats to use a C function you have written.  For example, you can
     safely use format strings from user input to implement a `printf'-like
     function for another programming language.	 Extended `getopt' functions
     are already used to parse options, including long options, in many GNU
     utilities.

     The C Library runs on Sun-3 (SunOS 4.1), Sun-4 (SunOS 4.1 or Solaris 2),
     HP 9000/300 (4.3BSD), SONY News 800 (NewsOS 3 or 4), MIPS DECstation
     (Ultrix 4), DEC Alpha (OSF/1), i386/i486 (System V, SVR4, BSD, SCO 3.2 &
     SCO ODT 2.0), Sequent Symmetry i386 (Dynix 3) & SGI (Irix 4).  Texinfo
     source for the `GNU C Library Reference Manual' is included (*note
     Documentation::.); the manual is now being updated.

   * GNU C++ Library	 (BinCD, DjgpD, DosBC, LangT, SrcCD)

     The GNU C++ library (libg++) contains an extensive collection of C++
     `forest' classes, an IOStream library for input/output routines, and
     support tools for use with G++.  Supported classes include: Obstacks,
     multiple-precision Integers and Rationals, Complex numbers, arbitrary
     length Strings, BitSets, and BitStrings.	Version 2.6.2 includes the
     initial release of the libstdc++ library.	This implements library
     facilities defined by the forthcoming ANSI/ISO C++ standard, including
     the Standard Template Library.

   * Calc     (DosBC, LspEmcT, SrcCD) [FSFman, FSFrc]

     Calc (written by Dave Gillespie in Emacs Lisp) is an extensible, advanced
     desk calculator & mathematical tool that runs as part of GNU Emacs.  You
     can use Calc just as a simple four-function calculator, but it has many
     more features including: choice of algebraic or RPN (stack-based) entry;
     logarithmic, trigonometric & financial functions; arbitrary precision;
     complex numbers; vectors; matrices; dates; times; infinities; sets;
     algebraic simplification; differentiation & integration.  It outputs to
     `gnuplot', & comes with source for a reference card & a manual.  *Note
     Documentation::.

   * `cfengine'	    (SrcCD, UtilT)

     `cfengine' is used for maintaining site-wide configuration of a
     heterogenous Unix network using a simple high level language.  Its
     functionality is similar to `rdist', but also allows many more
     operations to be performed automatically.

   * GNU Chess	   (SrcCD, UtilT, WdwsD)

     GNU Chess lets the computer play a full game of chess with you.  It runs
     on most platforms & has dumb terminal, "curses", & X terminal interfaces
     (based on the `xboard' program).	GNU Chess has many special features
     including the null move heuristic, a hash table with aging, the history
     heuristic (another form of the earlier killer heuristic), caching of
     static evaluations, & a database which lets it play the first several
     moves of the game quickly.	  Recent improvements include better
     heuristics, faster evaluation, thinking on opponent's time, a perfect
     King and Pawn vs King endgame routine, Swedish & German language
     support, support for more book formats, a rudimentary Bobby Fischer
     clock, & bug fixes.   It is primarily supported by Stuart Cracraft, Chua
     Kong Sian, & Tim Mann on behalf of the FSF.

   * CLISP     (LspEmcT, SrcCD)

     CLISP is a Common Lisp implementation by Bruno Haible and Michael Stoll.
     It mostly supports the Lisp described by `Common LISP: The Language (2nd
     edition)' and the ANSI Common Lisp standard.  CLISP includes an
     interpreter, a byte-compiler, a large subset of CLOS, a foreign language
     interface and, for some machines, a screen editor.	 The user interface
     language (English, German, French) is chooseable at run time.  Major
     packages that run in CLISP include CLX & Garnet.  CLISP needs only 2 MB
     of memory & runs on many microcomputers (including MS-DOS systems, OS/2,
     Atari ST, Amiga 500-4000, Acorn RISC PC) & Unix-like systems (GNU/Linux,
     Sun4, SVR4, SGI, HP-UX, DEC Alpha, NeXTstep & others).

   * GNU Common Lisp	 (LspEmcT, SrcCD)

     GNU Common Lisp (GCL) has a compiler and interpreter for Common Lisp.  It
     used to be known as Kyoto Common Lisp.  It is very portable and extremely
     efficient on a wide class of applications.	 It compares favorably in
     performance with commercial Lisps on several large theorem-prover and
     symbolic algebra systems.	It supports the CLtL1 specification but is
     moving towards the proposed ANSI definition.   GCL compiles to C and
     then uses the native optimizing C compilers (e.g., GCC).  A function
     with a fixed number of args and one value turns into a C function of the
     same number of args, returning one value, so GCL is maximally efficient
     on such calls.  It has a conservative garbage collector which allows
     great freedom for the C compiler to put Lisp values in arbitrary
     registers.	 It has a source level Lisp debugger for interpreted code,
     with display of source code in an Emacs window.  Its profiling tools
     (based on the C profiling tools) count function calls and the time spent
     in each function.	CLX works with GCL.

     There is now a built-in interface with the TK widget system.  It runs in
     a separate process so that users may monitor progress on Lisp
     computations or interact with running computations via a windowing
     interface.

     There is also an Xlib interface via C (xgcl-2).  PCL runs with GCL (see
     PCL item later in this article).  *Note Forthcoming GNUs::, for plans
     regarding GCL or for recent developments.	 GCL version 2.0 is released
     under the GNU Library General Public License.

   * `cpio'	(DjgpD, DosBC, SrcCD, UtilD, UtilT)

     `cpio' is an alternative archive program with all the features of SVR4
     `cpio', including support for the final POSIX 1003.1 `ustar' standard.
     `mt', a program to position magnetic tapes, is included with `cpio'.

   * CVS     (SrcCD, UtilT)

     CVS, the Concurrent Version System, manages software revision & release
     control at a multi-developer, multi-directory, multi-group site.  It
     works best with RCS versions 4 and above, but will parse older RCS
     formats with the loss of CVS's fancier features.  See Berliner, Brian,
     "CVS-II: Parallelizing Software Development," `Proceedings of the Winter
     1990 USENIX Association Conference'.  To find out how to get a copy,
     contact `office@usenix.org'.

   * DejaGnu	 (LangT, SrcCD)

     DejaGnu is a framework to test programs with a single front end for all
     tests.  The framework's flexibility & consistency makes it easy to write
     tests.  DejaGnu comes with `expect', which runs scripts to conduct
     dialogs with programs.

   * Diffutils	   (DjgpD, DosBC, SrcCD, UtilT)

     GNU `diff' compares files showing line-by-line changes in several
     flexible formats.	It is much faster than traditional Unix versions.  The
     Diffutils package contains `diff', `diff3', `sdiff', & `cmp'.  Recent
     improvements include more consistent handling of character sets and a
     new `diff' option to do all input/output in binary; this is useful on
     some non-Posix hosts.  Plans for the Diffutils package include support
     for internationalization (e.g., error messages in Chinese) and for some
     non-Unix PC environments.

   * DJGPP     (BinCD, DjgpD, DosBC)

     DJ Delorie has ported GCC/G++ 2.6.0 (see "GCC" in this article) to i386s
     running MS-DOS.  DJGPP also has a 32-bit i386 DOS extender with symbolic
     debugger; development libraries; & ports of Bison, `flex', GAS &
     Binutils.	Full source code is provided.  It needs at least 5MB of hard
     disk space to install & 512K of RAM to use.  It supports SVGA (up to
     1024x768), XMS & VDISK memory allocation, `himem.sys', VCPI (e.g., QEMM,
     DESQview & 386MAX) & DPMI (e.g., Windows 3.x, OS/2, QEMM & QDPMI).	 Ask
     `djgpp-request@sun.soe.clarkson.edu' to join a DJGPP users mailing list.

   * `dld'     (LangT, SrcCD)

     `dld' is a dynamic linker written by W. Wilson Ho.	 Linking your program
     with the `dld' library allows you to dynamically load object files into
     the running binary.  Currently supported are VAX (Ultrix), Sun 3 (SunOS
     3.4 & 4.0), SPARC (SunOS 4.0), Sequent Symmetry (Dynix) & Atari ST.

   * `doschk'	  (DjgpD, DosBC, SrcCD, UtilT)

     This program is intended as a utility to help software developers ensure
     that their source file names are distinguishable on System V platforms
     with 14-character filenames and on MS-DOS with 8+3 character filenames.

   * `ecc'     (LangT, SrcCD)

     `ecc' is a Reed-Solomon error correction checking program, which can
     correct three byte errors in a block of 255 bytes and detect more severe
     errors.  Contact `paulf@Stanford.EDU' for more information.

   * `ed'     (SrcCD, UtilT)

     Ed is the standard text editor.

   * Elib     (DosBC, LspEmcT, SrcCD)

     Elib is a small library of Emacs Lisp functions, including routines for
     using AVL trees and doubly-linked lists.

   * GNU Emacs	   **Note Forthcoming GNUs:: for future plans.*

     In 1975, Richard Stallman developed the first Emacs, an extensible,
     customizable real-time display editor & computing environment.  GNU Emacs
     is his second implementation.  It offers true Lisp--smoothly integrated
     into the editor--for writing extensions & provides an interface to the X
     Window System.  It also runs on MS-DOS & Windows NT.  In addition to its
     powerful native command set, Emacs has extensions which emulate the
     editors vi & EDT (DEC's VMS editor).  Emacs has many other features which
     make it a full computing support environment.  Source for the `GNU Emacs
     Manual', & a reference card comes with the software.  Source for the
     `GNU Emacs Lisp Reference Manual' & `Programming in Emacs Lisp: An
     Introduction' are distributed in separate packages.  *Note
     Documentation::.

   * GNU Emacs 18     (LspEmcT, SrcCD, VMSEmcsT) [FSFrc]

     Emacs 18.59 is the last release of version 18 from the FSF.  We no longer
     maintain it.  It runs on many Unix systems: Alliant FX/80 & FX/2800,
     Altos 3068, Amdahl (UTS), Apollo, AT&T (3Bs & 7300 PC), DG Aviion, Bull
     DPX/2 (2nn & 3nn) CCI 5/32 & 6/32, Celerity, Convex, Digital (DECstation

     vers.), Tadpole, Tahoe, Tandem Integrity S2, Tektronix (16000 & 4300),
     Triton 88, Ustation E30 (SS5E), Whitechapel (MG1) & Wicat.

   * GNU Emacs 19     (DosBC, EmacsD, LspEmcT, SrcCD) [FSFman(s), FSFrc]

     Emacs 19 works with character-only terminals & with the X Window System
     (with or without the X toolkit).  New features in Emacs 19 include:
     multiple X windows ("frames" to Emacs), with either a separate X window
     for the minibuffer or a minibuffer attached to each X window; property
     lists associated with regions of text in a buffer; multiple fonts &
     colors defined by those properties; simplified/improved processing of
     function keys, mouse clicks, & mouse movement; X selection processing,
     including clipboard selections; hooks to be run if point or mouse moves
     outside a certain range; menu bars & popup menus defined by keymaps;
     scrollbars; before & after change hooks; source-level debugging of Emacs
     Lisp programs; floating point numbers; improved buffer allocation,
     including returning storage to the system when a buffer is killed;
     interfacing with the X resource manager; many updated libraries; &
     support for European character sets, RCS, & the GNU configuration scheme.

     Recent features include support for Motif widgets & the Athena widgets,
     displaying multiple views of an outline at the same time, version
     control support for CVS & for multiple branches, the ability to open
     frames on more than one X display from a single Emacs job, operation on
     MS-DOS, MS Windows, & Windows NT, commands to edit text properties &
     save them in files, text properties for formatting text, & GNU-standard
     long-named command line options.

     Emacs 19.29 is believed to work on: Acorn Risc machine (RISCiX); Alliant
     FX/2800 (BSD); Alpha (OSF/1); Apollo (DomainOS); Bull DPX/2 2nn & 3nn
     (SysV.3) & sps7 (SysV.2); Clipper; Convex (BSD); Cubix QBx (SysV); Data

     Other configurations supported by Emacs 18 should work with few changes
     in Emacs 19; as users tell us more about their experiences with different
     systems, we will augment the list.	 Also see *Note Forthcoming GNUs::.

   * `es'     (SrcCD, UtilT)

     `es' is an extensible shell based on `rc' with first class functions,
     lexical scope, exceptions and rich return values (i.e., functions can
     return values other than just numbers).  `es''s extensibility comes from
     the ability to modify and extend the shell's built-in services, such as
     path searching and redirection.  Like `rc', it is great for both
     interactive use and for scripting, particularly since its quoting rules
     are much less baroque than the C or Bourne shells.

   * `f2c'     (LangT, SrcCD)

     `f2c' converts Fortran-77 source into C or C++, which can be compiled
     with GCC or G++.  Get bug fixes by FTP from site `netlib.att.com' or by
     email from `netlib@research.att.com'.  See file `/netlib/f2c/changes.Z'
     for a summary.  *Note Forthcoming GNUs::, for info about GNU Fortran.

   * Fileutils	   (DjgpD, DosBC, SrcCD, UtilT)

     The fileutils work on files: `chgrp', `chmod', `chown', `cp', `dd', `df',
     `dir', `du', `install', `ln', `ls', `mkdir', `mkfifo', `mknod', `mv',
     `mvdir', `rm', `rmdir', `sync', `touch', & `vdir'.

   * Findutils	   (DjgpD, DosBC, SrcCD, UtilT)

     `find' is frequently used both interactively and in shell scripts to
     find files which match certain criteria and perform arbitrary operations
     on them.  Also included are `xargs', which apply a command to a list of
     files, and `locate', which scans a database for file names that match a
     pattern.

   * Finger	(SrcCD, UtilT)

     GNU Finger has more features than other finger programs.  For sites with
     many hosts, a single host may be designated as the finger "server" host
     and other hosts at that site configured as finger "clients".  The server
     host collects information about who is logged in to the clients.  To
     finger a user at a GNU Finger site, a query to any of its client hosts
     gets useful information.  GNU Finger supports many customization
     features, including user output filters and site programmable output for
     special target names.

   * `flex'	(BinCD, DjgpD, DosBC, LangT, SrcCD, UtilD) [FSFman, FSFrc]

     `flex' is a replacement for the `lex' scanner generator.  `flex' was
     written by Vern Paxson of the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory and generates
     far more efficient scanners than `lex' does.  Source for the `Flex
     Manual' and reference card are included.  *Note Documentation::.

   * FlexFAX	 *See the HylaFAX item elsewhere in this article*

   * GNU Fortran (`g77')     **Note Forthcoming GNUs::*	  (LangT, SrcCD)

     GNU Fortran (`g77'), developed by Craig Burley, is available for public
     beta testing on the Internet.  For now, `g77' produces code that is
     mostly object-compatible with `f2c' & uses the same run-time library
     (`libf2c').

   * Fontutils	   (SrcCD, UtilT)

     The programs (`bpltobzr', `bzrto', `charspace', `fontconvert',
     `gsrenderfont', `imageto', `imgrotate', `limn', & `xbfe') create fonts
     for use with Ghostscript or TeX (starting with a scanned type image &
     converting the bitmaps to outlines), convert between font formats, et al.

   * GAWK     (DjgpD, DosBC, LangT, SrcCD) [FSFman]

     GAWK is upwardly compatible with the latest POSIX specification of
     `awk'.  It also provides several useful extensions not found in other
     `awk' implementations.  Texinfo source for the `GAWK Manual' comes with
     the software.  *Note Documentation::.

   * GCC     (BinCD, DjgpD, DosBC, LangT, SrcCD, VMSCmpT) [FSFman]

     Version 2 of the GNU C Compiler supports multiple languages; the source
     file name suffix or a compiler option selects the language.  The GNU C
     Compiler distribution includes support for C, C++ and Objective-C.
     Support for Objective-C was donated by NeXT.  The runtime support needed
     to run Objective-C programs is now distributed with GCC (this does not
     include any Objective-C classes aside from `object').  As much as
     possible, G++ is kept compatible with the evolving draft ANSI standard,
     but not with `cfront' (AT&T's compiler), which has been diverging from
     ANSI.

     The GNU C Compiler is a fairly portable optimizing compiler which
     performs automatic register allocation, common sub-expression
     elimination, invariant code motion from loops, induction variable
     optimizations, constant propagation and copy propagation, delayed
     popping of function call arguments, tail recursion elimination,
     integration of inline functions and frame pointer elimination,
     instruction scheduling, loop unrolling, filling of delay slots, leaf
     function optimization, optimized multiplication by constants, a certain
     amount of common subexpression elimination (CSE) between basic blocks
     (though not all of the supported machine descriptions provide for
     scheduling or delay slots), a feature for assigning attributes to
     instructions and many local optimizations that are automatically deduced
     from the machine description.  Position-independent code is supported on
     the 68k, i386, i486, Pentium, Hitachi Slt, Hitachi H8/300, Clipper, 88k,
     SPARC & SPARClite.

     GCC can open-code most arithmetic on 64-bit values (type `long long
     int').  It supports extended floating point (type `long double') on the
     68k; other machines will follow.

     GCC supports full ANSI C, traditional C, & GNU C extensions (including:
     nested functions support, nonlocal gotos, & taking the address of a
     label).

     GCC can generate a.out, COFF, ELF, & OSF-Rose files when used with a
     suitable assembler.  It can produce debugging information in these
     formats: BSD stabs, COFF, ECOFF, ECOFF with stabs & DWARF.

     GCC generates code for many CPUs, including: a29k, Alpha, ARM, AT&T
     DSP1610, Convex cN, Clipper, Elxsi, Fujitsu Gmicro, H8/300, HP-PA (1.0
     and 1.1) i370, i386, i486, Pentium, i860, i960, m68k, m68020, m68030,
     m68040, m88k, MIL-STD-1750a, MIPS, ns32k, PDP-11, Pyramid, ROMP, RS6000,
     SH, SPARC, SPARClite, VAX & we32k.

     Operating systems supported include: GNU/Linux, AIX, ACIS, AOS, BSD,
     Clix, Ctix, DG/UX, Dynix, Genix, GNU, HP-UX, ISC, Irix, Luna, LynxOS,
     Mach, Minix, NetBSD, NewsOS, OSF, OSF-Rose, RISCOS, SCO, Solaris 2,
     SunOS 4, SysV, Ultrix, Unos, VMS & Windows/NT.

     Using the configuration scheme for GCC, building a cross-compiler is as
     easy as building a native compiler.

     We no longer maintain version 1 of GCC, G++, or libg++.

     Texinfo source for the `Using and Porting GNU CC' manual, is included
     with GCC.	 *Note Forthcoming GNUs::, for plans for later releases of
     GCC.

   * GDB     (BinCD, DjgpD, DosBC, LangT, SrcCD) [FSFman, FSFrc]

     GDB, the GNU DeBugger, is a source-level debugger for C, C++, & Fortran.

     GDB can debug both C and C++ programs, and will work with executables
     produced by many different compilers; however, C++ debugging will have
     some limitations if you do not use GCC.

     GDB has a command line user interface; Emacs comes with a GDB mode, and
     `xxgdb' provides an X interface (but it is not distributed or maintained
     by the FSF; FTP it from `ftp.x.org' in directory `/contrib/utilities').

     Executable files and symbol tables are read via the BFD library, which
     allows a single copy of GDB to debug programs with multiple object file
     formats (e.g., a.out, COFF, ELF).	Other features include a rich command
     language, remote debugging over serial lines or TCP/IP, and watchpoints
     (breakpoints triggered when the value of an expression changes).

     GDB uses a standard remote interface to a simulator library which (so
     far) has simulators for the Zilog Z8001/2, Hitachi H8/300, H8/500, &
     Super-H.

     GDB can perform cross-debugging.  To say that GDB "targets" a platform
     means it can perform native or cross-debugging for it.  To say that GDB
     can "host" a given platform means that it can be built on it, but cannot
     necessarily debug native programs.	 GDB can:

	* "target" & "host": Amiga 3000 (Amix), DEC Alpha (OSF/1), DECstation
	  3100 & 5000 (Ultrix), HP 9000/300 (BSD, HP-UX), HP 9000/700 (HP-UX),
	  i386 (GNU/Linux, BSD, FreeBSD, LynxOS, NetBSD, SCO), IBM RS/6000
	  (AIX, LynxOS), Motorola Delta m88k (System V, CX/UX), PC532
	  (NetBSD), Motorola m68k MVME-167 (LynxOS), NCR 3000 (SVR4), SGI
	  (Irix V3, V4, V5), SONY News (NewsOS 3.x), SPARC (SunOS 4.1,
	  Solaris, NetBSD, LynxOS) Sun-3 (SunOS 4.1), & Ultracomputer (a29k
	  running Sym1).

	* "target", but not "host": AMD 29000 (COFF & a.out), Hitachi H8/300,
	  Hitachi SH, i386 (a.out, COFF, OS/9000) i960 (Nindy, VxWorks),
	  m68k/m68332 (a.out, COFF, VxWorks), MIPS (IDT ecoff, ELF), Fujitsu
	  SPARClite (a.out, COFF), & Z8000.

	* "host", but not "target": IBM RT/PC (AIX), and HP/Apollo 68k (BSD).

     GDB can use the symbol tables emitted by the vendor-supplied compilers of
     most MIPS-based machines, including DEC.  (These tables are in a format
     which almost nobody else uses.)  Source for the manual
     `Debugging with GDB' and a reference card are included.  *Note
     Documentation::.

   * `gdbm'	(LangT, SrcCD, UtilD)

     `gdbm' is the GNU replacement for the traditional `dbm' and `ndbm'
     libraries.	 It implements a database using quick lookup by hashing.
     `gdbm' does not ordinarily make sparse files (unlike its Unix and BSD
     counterparts).

   * Ghostscript     (DjgpD, DosBC, SrcCD, UtilT)

     The GNU release of Ghostscript is an interpreter for the Postscript
     graphics language (*note Forthcoming GNUs::., for future plans).

     The current version of GNU Ghostscript is 2.6.2.  Features include the
     ability to use the fonts provided by the platform on which Ghostscript
     runs (X Window System and Microsoft Windows), resulting in much
     better-looking screen displays; improved text file printing (like
     `enscript'); a utility to extract the text from a Postscript language
     document; a much more reliable (and faster) Microsoft Windows
     implementation; support for Microsoft C/C++ 7.0; drivers for many new
     printers, including the SPARCprinter, and for TIFF/F (fax) file format;
     many more Postscript Level 2 facilities, including most of the color
     space facilities (but not patterns), and the ability to switch between
     Level 1 and Level 2 dynamically.  Version 2.6.2 adds a LaserJet 4 driver
     and several important bug fixes to version 2.6.1.

     Ghostscript executes commands in the Postscript language by writing
     directly to a printer, drawing on an X window or writing to a file for
     later printing (or to a bitmap file that you can manipulate with other
     graphics programs).

     Ghostscript includes a C-callable graphics library (for client programs
     that do not want to deal with the Postscript language).  It also supports
     IBM PCs and compatibles with EGA, VGA or SuperVGA graphics (but please do
     *not* ask the FSF staff any questions about this; we do not use PCs).

   * Ghostview	   (DjgpD, DosBC, SrcCD, UtilT)

     Tim Theisen, `ghostview@cs.wisc.edu', created Ghostview, a previewer for
     multi-page files with an X user interface.	 Ghostview & Ghostscript work
     together; Ghostview creates a viewing window & Ghostscript draws in it.

   * GIT     (SrcCD, UtilT)

     GIT is a set of interactive tools.	 It has an extensible file system
     browser, an ASCII/hex file viewer, a process viewer/killer, and other
     related utilities and shell scripts.  It can be used to increase the
     speed and efficiency of many daily tasks, such as copying and moving
     files and directories, invoking editors, compressing and uncompressing
     files, creating and expanding archives, compiling programs, sending
     mail, etc.	 It looks nice, has colors (if the standard ANSI color
     sequences are supported), and is user-friendly.

   * `gmp'     (LangT, SrcCD)

     GNU `mp' is a library for arbitrary precision arithmetic on signed
     integers and rational numbers.  It has a rich set of functions with a
     regular interface.

   * GNATS     (SrcCD, UtilT)

     GNATS (GNats: A Tracking System, not to be confused with GNAT, The GNU
     Ada Translator) is a bug-tracking system.	It is based upon the paradigm
     of a central site or organization which receives problem reports and
     negotiates their resolution by electronic mail.  Although it has been
     used primarily as a software bug-tracking system so far, it is
     sufficiently generalized so that it could be used for handling system
     administration issues, project management, or any number of other
     applications.

   * `gnuplot'	   (SrcCD, UtilT, WdwsD)

     `gnuplot' is an interactive program for plotting mathematical
     expressions and data.  It plots both curves (2 dimensions) & surfaces (3
     dimensions).  Curiously, it was neither written nor named for the GNU
     Project; the name is a coincidence.  Various GNU programs use `gnuplot'.

   * GnuGo     (SrcCD, UtilT)

     GnuGo plays the game of Go (Wei-Chi); it is not yet very sophisticated.

   * `gperf'	 (LangT, SrcCD)

     `gperf' generates perfect hash tables.  The C version is in package
     cperf.  The C++ version is in libg++.  Both produce hash functions in
     either C or C++.

   * GNU Graphics     (SrcCD, UtilT)

     GNU Graphics produces x-y plots from ASCII or binary data.	 It outputs
     in Postscript, Tektronix 4010 compatible, and Unix device-independent
     "plot" formats.  It has a previewer for the X Window System.  Features
     include a `spline' interpolation program; examples of shell scripts
     using `graph' and `plot'; a statistics toolkit; and output in TekniCAD
     TDA and ln03 file formats.	 Email bugs or queries to Rich Murphey,
     `Rich@lamprey.utmb.edu'.

   * grep     (DjgpD, DosBC, SrcCD, UtilT)

     This package has GNU `grep', `egrep', and `fgrep' which find lines that
     match inputed patterns.  They are much faster than the traditional Unix
     versions.

   * Groff     (DjgpD, DosBC, SrcCD, UtilT)

     Groff is a document formatting system based on a device-independent
     troff & includes: `eqn', `nroff', `pic', `refer', `tbl', `troff'; the
     `man', `ms', `mm' macros; & drivers for Postscript, TeX `dvi' format and
     typewriter-like devices.  Groff's `mm' macro package is almost
     compatible with the DWB `mm' macros with several extensions.  Also
     included is a modified version of the Berkeley `me' macros and an
     enhanced version of the X11 `xditview' previewer.	Written in C++, these
     programs can be compiled with GNU C++ Version 2.5 or later.  A driver
     for the LaserJet 4 series of printers is currently in test.

     Groff users are encouraged to contribute enhancements.  Most needed are
     complete Texinfo documentation, a `grap' emulation (a `pic' preprocessor
     for typesetting graphs), a page-makeup postprocessor similar to `pm'
     (see `Computing Systems', Vol. 2, No. 2; ask `office@usenix.org' how to
     get a copy), and an ASCII output class for `pic' so that `pic' can be
     integrated with Texinfo.  Questions and bug reports from users who have
     read the documentation provided with groff can be sent to
     `bug-groff@prep.ai.mit.edu'.

   * `gzip'	(DjgpD, DosBC, LangT, LspEmcT, SrcCD, UtilT)

     `gzip' can expand LZW-compressed files but uses another, unpatented
     algorithm for compression which generally produces better results.	 It
     also expands files compressed with System V's `pack' program.

   * `hello'	 (DjgpD, DosBC, SrcCD, UtilT)

     The GNU `hello' program produces a familiar, friendly greeting.  It
     allows non-programmers to use a classic computer science tool which would
     otherwise be unavailable to them.	Because it is protected by the GNU
     General Public License, users are free to share and change it.

     Like any truly useful program, `hello' contains a built-in mail reader.

   * `hp2xx'	 (SrcCD, UtilT)

     GNU `hp2xx' reads HP-GL files, decomposes all drawing commands into
     elementary vectors, and converts them into a variety of vector and raster
     output formats.  It is also an HP-GL previewer.  Currently supported
     vector formats include encapsulated Postscript, Uniplex RGIP, Metafont,
     and various special TeX-related formats, and simplified HP-GL (line
     drawing only) for imports.	 Raster formats supported include IMG, PBM,
     PCX & HP-PCL (including Deskjet & DJ5xxC support).	 Previewers work
     under X11 (Unix), OS/2 (PM & full screen), MS-DOS (SVGA, VGA & HGC).

   * HylaFAX	 (SrcCD, UtilT)

     HylaFAX (once named FlexFAX) is a facsimile system for Unix systems.  It
     supports sending, receiving, & polled retrieval of facsimile, as well as
     transparent shared data use of the modem.	 Details are available on the
     World Wide Web at: `http://www.vix.com/hylafax/'.

   * `indent'	  (DjgpD, DosBC, LangT, SrcCD, UtilD)

     GNU `indent' is a revision of the BSD version.  By default, it formats C
     source according to the GNU coding standards.  The BSD default, K&R, and
     other formats are available as options.  It is also possible to define
     your own format.  GNU `indent' is more robust and provides more
     functionality than other versions, for example, it handles C++ comments.

   * Ispell	(DjgpD, DosBC, SrcCD, UtilT)

     Ispell is an interactive spell checker that suggests "near misses" to
     replace unrecognized words.  System & user-maintained dictionaries for
     multiple languages can be used.  Standalone & Emacs interfaces are
     available.	  Previously, the FSF had its own version of ispell ("Ispell
     4.0"), but has dropped it for a parallel branch that has had more
     development ("Ispell 3.1.18").  (Ispell 3 was an earlier release by the
     original Ispell author, but others have since made it more
     sophisticated.)

   * JACAL     *Not available from the FSF except by FTP*

     JACAL is a symbolic mathematics system for the
     manipulation/simplification of equations, single & multiple-valued
     algebraic expressions made up of numbers, variables, radicals,
     differential operators, & algebraic & holonomic functions.	 Vectors,
     matrices, & tensors of these objects are supported.

     JACAL was written in Scheme by Aubrey Jaffer.  It comes with SCM, an IEEE
     P1178 & R4RS compliant version of Scheme written in C.  SCM runs on
     Amiga, Atari-ST, MS-DOS, OS/2, NOS/VE, Unicos, VMS, Unix & similar
     systems.  SLIB is a portable Scheme library used by JACAL.	 The FSF is
     not distributing JACAL on any media.  To get an IBM PC floppy disk with

   * `less'	(SrcCD, UtilD, UtilT)

     `less' is a display paginator similar to `more' and `pg' but with
     various features (such as the ability to scroll backwards) that most
     pagers lack.

   * `m4'     (DjgpD, DosBC, SrcCD, UtilD, UtilT)

     GNU `m4' is an implementation of the traditional Unix macro processor.
     It is mostly SVR4 compatible, although it has some extensions (e.g.,
     handling more than 9 positional parameters to macros).  `m4' also has
     built-in functions for including files, running shell commands, doing
     arithmetic, etc.

   * `make' (BinCD,DjgpD,DosBC,LangT,LspEmcT,SrcCD,UtilD,UtilT)[FSFman]

     GNU `make' supports POSIX 1003.2 and has all but a few obscure features
     of the BSD and System V versions of `make'.  GNU extensions include long
     options, parallel compilation, flexible implicit pattern rules,
     conditional execution, & powerful text manipulation functions.  Texinfo
     source for the `Make Manual' comes with the program.  *Note
     Documentation::.

     `mkisofs' is a pre-mastering program to generate an ISO 9660 file system.
     It takes a snapshot of a directory tree, and makes a binary image which
     corresponds to an ISO 9660 file system when written to a block device.

     `mkisofs' can also generate the System Use Sharing Protocol records of
     the Rock Ridge Interchange Protocol (used to further describe the files
     in an ISO 9660 file system to a Unix host, and provides information such
     as longer filenames, uid/gid, POSIX permissions, and block and character
     devices).

   * mtools	(SrcCD, UtilT)

     mtools is a set of public domain programs to allow Unix systems to read,
     write, and manipulate files on an MS-DOS file system (usually a
     diskette).

   * MULE     (DosBC, EmcsD, LspEmcT, SrcCD)

     MULE is a MULtilingual Enhancement to GNU Emacs.  A text buffer in MULE
     can contain a mix of characters from many languages including: Japanese,
     Chinese, Korean, Vietnamese, Thai, Greek, the ISO Latin-1 through
     Latin-5 character sets, Ukrainian, Arabic, Hebrew, Russian, and other
     Cyrillic alphabets.  To input any of these characters, you can use
     various input methods provided by MULE itself.  In addition, if you use
     MULE under some terminal emulators (kterm, cxterm, or exterm), you can
     use its input methods.  MULE is being merged into GNU Emacs.  *Note GNU
     & Other Free Software in Japan::, for more information about MULE.

     `patch' is our version of Larry Wall's program to take `diff''s output
     and apply those differences to an original file to generate the modified
     version.

   * PCL     (LspEmcT, SrcCD)

     PCL is a free implementation of a large subset of CLOS, the Common Lisp
     Object System.  It runs under both GCL and CLISP, mentioned above.

   * `perl'	(LangT, SrcCD)

     Larry Wall's `perl' combines the features and capabilities of `sed',

     `pine' is a friendly, menu-driven electronic mail manager.

   * `ptx'     (SrcCD, UtilD, UtilT)

     GNU `ptx' is our version of the traditional permuted index generator.  It
     handles multiple input files at once, produces TeX compatible output, &
     outputs readable "KWIC" (KeyWords In Context) indexes.  It does not yet
     handle input files that do not fit in memory all at once.

   * `rc'     (SrcCD, UtilT)

     `rc' is a shell that features a C-like syntax (much more so than `csh')
     and far cleaner quoting rules than the C or Bourne shells.	 It's
     intended to be used interactively, but is also great for writing
     scripts.  It inspired the shell `es'.

   * RCS     (SrcCD, UtilD, UtilT)

     RCS, the Revision Control System, is used for version control &
     management of software projects.  Used with GNU `diff', RCS can handle

     CVS item above.

   * `recode'	  (SrcCD, UtilT)

     GNU `recode' converts files between character sets and usages.  When
     exact transliterations are not possible, it may get rid of the offending
     characters or fall back on approximations.	 This program recognizes or
     produces nearly 150 different character sets and is able to
     transliterate files between almost any pair.  Most RFC 1345 character
     sets are supported.

   * `regex'	 (LangT, SrcCD)

     The GNU regular expression library supports POSIX.2, except for
     internationalization features.  It is included in many GNU programs which
     do regular expression matching & is available separately.	An alternate
     regular expression package, `rx', is faster than `regex' in most cases &
     will replace `regex' over time.

   * rx	    (LangT, SrcCD)

     Tom Lord has written `rx', a new regular expression library which is
     faster than the older GNU `regex' library.	 It is now being distributed
     with `sed' and `tar'.  `rx' will be used in the next releases of `m4'
     and `ptx'.

   * `saoimage'	    (UtilT)

     SAOimage is an X-based astronomical image viewer.	It reads data images
     and displays them with a pseudocolor colormap.  There is full interactive

     emulates a DEC VT100 plus several ISO 6429 (ECMA 48, ANSI X3.64) and ISO
     2022 functions.  Arbitrary keyboard input translation is also supported.
     `screen' sessions can be detached and resumed later on a different
     terminal type.  Output in detached sessions is saved for later viewing.

   * `sed'     (DjgpD, DosBC, SrcCD, UtilD, UtilT)

     `sed' is a stream-oriented version of `ed'.  It comes with the `rx'
     library.

   * Sharutils	   (SrcCD, UtilT)

     `shar' makes so-called shell archives out of many files, preparing them
     for transmission by electronic mail services, while `unshar' helps
     unpack these shell archives after reception.  `uuencode' prepares a file
     for transmission over an electronic channel which ignores or otherwise
     mangles the high order bit of bytes, while `uudecode' does the converse
     transformation.

   * Shellutils	    (DjgpD, DosBC, SrcCD, UtilT)

     They are: `basename', `date', `dirname', `echo', `env', `expr', `false',

     `true', `tty', `uname', `users', `who', `whoami', & `yes'.

   * GNU Shogi	   (SrcCD, UtilT)

     Shogi is a Japanese game similar to Chess; a major difference is that
     captured pieces can be returned into play.	  GNU Shogi is a variant of
     GNU Chess; it implements the same features & similar heuristics.  As a
     new feature, sequences of partial board patterns can be introduced to
     help the program play toward specific opening patterns.  It has both
     character and X display interfaces.   It is primarily supported by
     Matthias Mutz on behalf of the FSF.

   * Smalltalk	   *Also see *Note Forthcoming GNUs::*	 (LangT,SrcCD)

     GNU Smalltalk is an interpreted object-oriented programming language
     system written in highly portable C.  It has been ported to many Unix &
     some other platforms, including DOS (non-Unix ports are not available
     from the FSF).  Features include a binary image save capability, the
     ability to invoke user-written C code & pass parameters to it, an Emacs
     editing mode, a version of the X protocol invocable from Smalltalk,
     optional byte-code compilation and/or execution tracing, & automatically
     loaded per-user initialization files.  It implements all of the classes
     & protocol in the book "Smalltalk-80: The Language", except for the
     graphic user interface (GUI) related classes.

   * Superopt	  (LangT, SrcCD)

     Superopt is a function sequence generator that uses an exhaustive
     generate-and-test approach to find the shortest instruction sequence for
     a given function.	You provide a function as input, a CPU to generate
     code for, and how many instructions you want.  Its use in GCC is
     described in the `ACM SIGPLAN PLDI'92' proceedings.  It supports: SPARC,
     m68k, m68020, m88k, IBM RS/6000, AMD 29000, Intel 80x86, Pyramid, DEC
     Alpha & HP-PA.

   * `tar'     (SrcCD, UtilT)

     GNU `tar' includes multivolume support, the ability to archive sparse
     files, automatic archive compression/decompression, remote archives, and
     special features that allow `tar' to be used for incremental and full
     backups.  Unfortunately, GNU `tar' implements an early draft of the
     POSIX 1003.1 `ustar' standard which is different from the final
     standard.	Adding support for the new changes in a backward-compatible
     fashion is unfortunately not trivial.

   * Termcap Library	 (SrcCD, UtilT) [FSFman]

     The GNU Termcap library is a drop-in replacement for `libtermcap.a' on
     any system.  It does not place an arbitrary limit on the size of Termcap
     entries, unlike most other Termcap libraries.  Included is source for the
     `Termcap Manual' in Texinfo format.  *Note Documentation::.

   * TeX     (SrcCD)

     TeX is a document formatting system that handles complicated

   * Textutils	   (DjgpD, DosBC, SrcCD, UtilT)

     The Textutils programs manipulate textual data.  They include: `cat',
     `cksum', `comm', `csplit', `cut', `expand', `fmt', `fold', `head',
     `join', `nl', `od', `paste', `pr', `sort', `split', `sum', `tac', `tail',
     `tr', `unexpand', `uniq', and `wc'.

   * Tile Forth	    (LangT, SrcCD)

     Tile Forth is a 32-bit implementation of the Forth-83 standard written
     in C, allowing it to be easily ported to new systems and extended with
     "any" C-function (graphics, windowing, etc).   Many Forth libraries with
     full documentation are available including ones for top-down parsing,
     multi-threads, and object oriented programming.

   * `time'	(SrcCD, UtilT)

     `time' reports (usually from a shell) the user, system, & real time used
     by a process.  On some systems it also reports memory usage, page
     faults, et al.

   * `tput'	(SrcCD, UtilT)

     `tput' is a portable way for shell scripts to use special terminal
     capabilities.  Our `tput' uses the Termcap database, instead of Terminfo
     as most others do.

   * `ucblogo'	   (LangT, SrcCD)

     An implementation of the classic teaching language, Logo.

   * UUCP     (SrcCD, UtilT)

     This version of UUCP (written by Ian Lance Taylor) is GNU's standard
     UUCP system.  It supports the `f', `g' & `v' (in all window & packet
     sizes), `G', `t', `e', Zmodem, & two new bidirectional (`i' & `j')
     protocols.	 With a BSD sockets library, it can make TCP connections.
     With TLI libraries, it can make TLI connections.  Source is included for
     a manual (not yet published by the FSF).

   * `wdiff'	 (DjgpD, DosBC, SrcCD, UtilT)

     `wdiff' is a front-end to GNU `diff'.  It compares two files, finding
     the words deleted or added to the first to make the second.  It has many
     output formats and works well with terminals and pagers.  `wdiff' is
     very useful when two texts differ only by a few words and paragraphs
     have been refilled.

   * X11     *For details, see *Note X11 Tapes::*   (X11OptT, X11ReqT)

   * `Ygl'     (SrcCD, UtilT)

     `Ygl' emulates SGI's GL (Graphics Language) library under X11 on GNU/
     Linux with XFree, AIX 3.2, ConvexOS, HP-UX 7/8/9, SunOS, et al.

Tapes
*****

We offer Unix source code on tapes in `tar' format on these media:

   * 4mm DAT cartridges.

   * 8mm Exabyte cartridges.

   * Sun DC300XLP QIC-24 1/4in cartridges (readable on some other systems).

   * Hewlett-Packard 16-track DC600HC 1/4in cartridges.

   * IBM RS/6000 QIC-150 1/4in cartridges (readable on some other systems).

   * 1600bpi 9-track 1/2in reel tape.

The contents of the various tapes for Unix systems are the same (except the
RS/6000 Emacs tape also has binaries for Emacs); only the media are
different.  For prices, see the *note Free Software Foundation Order Form::..
Source code for the manuals & reference cards is included (*note
Documentation::.).

Some of the files on the tapes may be compressed with `gzip' to make them
fit.  Refer to the top-level `README' file at the beginning of each tape for
instructions on uncompressing them.  `uncompress' and `unpack' *do not work*!

Scheme Tape
-----------

Scheme is a simplified, lexically-scoped dialect of Lisp.  It was designed at
MIT and other universities to teach students the art of programming and to
research new parallel programming constructs and compilation techniques.

This tape now has MIT Scheme 7.3, which conforms to the "Revised^4 Report On
the Algorithmic Language Scheme" (MIT AI Lab Memo 848b), for which TeX source
is included.  It is written partly in C, but is presently hard to bootstrap.
Binaries that can be used to bootstrap it are available for: HP 9000 series
300, 400, 700, & 800 (running HP-UX 9.0), NeXT (NeXT OS 2 or 3.2), DEC Alpha
(OSF/1), IBM RS-6000 (AIX), Sun-3 or Sun-4 (SunOS 4.1), DECstation 3100/5100
(Ultrix 4.0), Sony NeWS-3250 (NEWS OS 5.01), & Intel i386 (MS-DOS, Windows
3.1 or NT).  If your system is not on this list & you don't enjoy the
bootstrap challenge, see "JACAL" in *Note GNU Software::.



X11 Tapes
---------

The two X11 tapes contain Version 11, Release 6 of the X Window System.	 The
first tape has all of the core software, documentation, & some contributed
clients.  We call this the "required" X tape since it is necessary for
running X or GNU Emacs under X.	 The second, "optional" tape has contributed
libraries & toolkits, the Andrew User Interface System, games, et al.

The X11 Required tape also contains all fixes and patches released to date.
We update this tape as new fixes and patches are released for programs on
both tapes.  *Note Tape & CD-ROM Subscription Service::.

We will distribute X11R5 on tape until X11R6 is stable and on the *Note
November 1993 Source Code CD-ROM::, while supplies last.



Berkeley 4.4BSD-Lite Tape
-------------------------

The "4.4BSD-Lite" release is the last from the Computer Systems Research
Group at the University of California at Berkeley.  It has most of the BSD
software system, except for a few files that remain proprietary.  It is much
more complete than the previous "Net2" release.



VMS Emacs and VMS Compiler Tapes
--------------------------------

We offer two VMS tapes.	 One has just GNU Emacs 18.59 (none of the other
software on the *Note Lisps/Emacs Tape::, is included).	 The other has GCC
2.3.3, Bison 1.19 (to compile GCC), GAS 1.38 (to assemble GCC's output), and
some library and include files (none of the other software on the *Note
Languages Tape::, is included).	 We are not aware of a GDB port for VMS.
Both VMS tapes have DEC VAX executables from which you can bootstrap, as the
DEC VMS C compiler cannot compile GCC.	We do not have executables for DEC
Alpha VMS systems.  Please do not ask us to devote effort to VMS support,
because it is peripheral to the GNU Project.



CD-ROMs
*******

We offer these CD-ROMs:

   * Several editions of our *Note Source Code CD-ROMs::.

   * *Note Compiler Tools Binaries CD-ROM::.

   * *Note MS-DOS Book with CD-ROM::, expected in late fall, 1995.

   * *Note Debian GNU/Linux Book with CD-ROM::, expected in late fall, 1995.

Our CD-ROMs are in ISO 9660 format & can be mounted as a read-only file
system on most computers.  If your driver supports it you can mount each
CD-ROM with "Rock Ridge" extensions (the MS-DOS CD-ROM is only in ISO 9660
format), & it will look just like an ordinary Unix file system, rather than
one full of truncated & otherwise mangled names that fit vanilla ISO 9660.

You can build most of the software without copying the sources off the CD.
You only need enough disk space for object files and intermediate build
targets.



Pricing of the GNU CD-ROMs
--------------------------

If a business or organization is ultimately paying, the June 1995 Source CD
costs $240.  It costs $60 if you, an individual, are paying out of your own
pocket.	 The December 1994 Compiler Tools Binaries CD-ROM costs $220 for a
business or organization, and $55 for an individual.



What do the individual and company prices mean?
...............................................

The software on our disks is free; anyone can copy it and anyone can run it.
What we charge for is the physical disk and the service of distribution.

We charge two different prices depending on who is buying.  When a company or
other organization buys the June 1995 Source CD-ROM, we charge $240.  When an
individual buys the same CD-ROM, we charge just $60.  This distinction is not
a matter of who is allowed to use the software.	 In either case, once you
have a copy, you can distribute as many copies as you wish and there's no
restriction on who can have or run them.  The price distinction is entirely a
matter of what kind of entity pays for the CD.

You, the reader, are certainly an individual, not a company.  If you are
buying a disk "in person", then you are probably doing so as an individual.
But if you expect to be reimbursed by your employer, then the disk is really
for the company; so please pay the company price and get reimbursed for it.
We won't try to check up on you--we use the honor system--so please cooperate.

Buying CDs at the company price is very helpful for GNU; just
140 Source CDs at that price supports an FSF programmer or tech writer for a
year.



Why is there an individual price?
.................................

In the past, our distribution tapes have been ordered mainly by companies.
The CD at the price of $240 provides them with all of our software for a much
lower price than they would previously have paid for six different tapes.  To
lower the price more would cut into the FSF's funds very badly and decrease
the software development we can do.

However, for individuals, $240 is too high a price; hardly anyone could
afford that.  So we decided to make CDs available to individuals at the lower
price of $60.



Is there a maximum price?
.........................

Our stated prices are minimum prices.  Feel free to pay a higher price if you
wish to support GNU development more.  The sky's the limit; we will accept as
high a price as you can offer.	Or simply give a donation (tax-deductible in
the U.S.) to the Free Software Foundation, a tax-exempt public charity.



December 1994 Compiler Tools Binaries CD-ROM
--------------------------------------------

We now have the second edition of the CD-ROM that has binaries for GNU
compiler tools for some systems which lack a compiler.	This enables the
people who use these systems to compile GNU and other free software without
having to buy a proprietary compiler.  You can also use these GNU tools to
compile your own C/C++/Objective-C programs.  The first edition of this CD is
available while supplies last at a reduced price; see the *note Free Software
Foundation Order Form::..

We hope to have more systems on each update of this CD.	 If you can help
build binaries for new systems (especially those that don't come with a C
compiler), or have one to suggest, please contact us at the addresses on page
1.

These packages:

	* DJGPP 1.12.m2 from GCC 2.6.0
	* GCC/G++/Objective-C 2.6.2
	* GNU C Library 1.09
	* GDB 4.13
	* Binutils 2.5.2
	* Bison 1.22
	* Emacs 19.26 (MS-DOS only)
	* Flex 2.4.7
	* Make 3.72.1
	* libg++ 2.6.1

On these platforms:

	* `i386-msdos'
	* `hppa1.1-hp-hpux9'
	* `sparc-sun-solaris2'
	* `sparc-sun-sunos4.1'



MS-DOS Book with CD-ROM
-----------------------

We hope to release our first Book describing GNU Software for MS-DOS in late
fall, 1995.  Contact either address on page 1 for more information then.  It
will include a CD-ROM with all the sources & binaries on the MS-DOS Diskettes.
For version numbers & some details, *note MS-DOS Diskettes::..



Debian GNU/Linux Book with CD-ROM
---------------------------------

We hope to release our first Book describing Debian GNU/Linux in late fall,
1995.  A CD will be inside the book with sources for Debian GNU/Linux.
GNU/Linux is a complete operating system for i386, i486, & Pentium machines,
available in both source code & binary form.  It is a GNU/Linux system--that
is to say, a variant GNU system which uses Linux as the kernel.	 (All the
systems now available that use the Linux kernel are GNU/Linux systems.)

Debian is being developed by Ian Murdock and the Debian Association in
conjunction with the Free Software Foundation.	We are distributing it as an
interim measure until the GNU kernel (the Hurd) is ready for users.

You can FTP Debian under `/pub/debian' from `ftp.cps.cmich.edu'.  For details
about Debian & how to get involved, see `/pub/gnu/GNUinfo/DEBIAN' on a GNU
FTP host (*Note How to Get GNU Software::).



Source Code CD-ROMs
-------------------

We have several versions of our Source Code CD-ROMs available, including:

   * *Note June 1995 Source Code CD-ROM::, the newest release.

   * *Note May 1994 Source Code CD-ROM::.

   * *Note November 1993 Source Code CD-ROM::.

These & other older Source CDs are available while supplies last at a reduced
price; see the *note Free Software Foundation Order Form::.  (please note
that the December 1994 Source CD is permanently out of stock).	All the
Source CDs also have Texinfo source for the GNU manuals listed in *Note
Documentation::.   The VMS tapes' contents are *not* included.	Many programs
that are only on MS-DOS diskettes & not on the tapes are also *not* included.
The MIT Scheme & X11 Optional tapes' contents are *not* on the November 1993,
May 1994, or June 1995 Source CDs.  *Note Tapes:: & *Note MS-DOS Diskettes::.

There are no precompiled programs on these Source CDs.	You will need a C
compiler (programs which need some other interpreter or compiler normally
provide the C source for a bootstrapping program).  We ship C compiler
binaries for some systems on the *Note Compiler Tools Binaries CD-ROM::.

MS-DOS Diskettes
****************

The FSF distributes some of the GNU software ported to MS-DOS, on 3.5inch
1.44MB diskettes. These disks have both sources and executables.



DJGPP Diskettes
---------------

We offer DJGPP on 30 diskettes.	 For further details, see *Note GNU
Software::.  The DJGPP diskettes contain the following:

	* bc 1.03
	* Binutils 2.4
	* Bison 1.22
	* cpio 2.3
	* Diffutils 2.6
	* doschk 1.1
	* Fileutils 3.9
	* Findutils 3.8
	* flex 2.4.7
	* GAS 2.4
	* Gawk 2.15.5
	* GCC 2.6.0
	* GDB 4.12
	* Ghostscript 2.6.1
	* Groff 1.09
	* gzip 1.24
	* hello 1.3
	* indent 1.9

	* sed 1.18
	* shellutils 1.9
	* Texinfo 3.1
	* texutils 1.9
	* wdiff 0.04



Emacs Diskettes
---------------

Two versions of GNU Emacs are included on the Emacs diskettes we distribute:
GNU Emacs version 19.28 handles 8-bit character sets; the other, MULE version
2.1, handles 16-bit character sets including Kanji.



Selected Utilities Diskettes
----------------------------

The GNUish MS-DOS Project ported GNU software to PC compatibles.  Though
GNUish is no longer active, users still ask for these ports done some years
ago.  We offer these ports on five diskettes.  To find out how to get them on
the Internet, you can FTP files `/pub/gnu/MicrosPorts/MSDOS*' from a GNU FTP
host (listed in *Note How to Get GNU Software::).  In general, the ports run
on 8086/80286-based 16-bit machines; an 80386 is not required.	Some are
necessarily missing features.	Included are: `cpio', `diff', `find', `flex',
`gdbm', `grep', `indent', `less', `m4', `make', `ptx', RCS, `sed', `shar',
`sort', & Texinfo.



Windows Diskette
----------------

We offer GNU Chess and `gnuplot' for Microsoft Windows on a single diskette.



Tape & CD-ROM Subscription Service
**********************************

If you do not have net access, our subscription service enables you to stay
current with the latest GNU developments.  For a one-time cost equivalent to
three tapes or CD-ROMs (plus shipping in some cases), we will ship you four
new versions of the tape of your choice or the Source Code CD-ROM.  The tapes
are sent each quarter; the CD-ROMs are sent as they are issued (currently
twice a year, but we hope to make it more frequent.)

Regularly, we will send you a new version of a Lisps/Emacs, Languages,
Utilities, or X Window System (X11R6) Required tape, or the Source CD-ROM.
The MIT Scheme and X Window System Optional tapes are not changed often
enough to warrant quarterly updates.  We do not yet know if we will be
offering subscriptions to the Compiler Tools Binaries or our new Books with
CD-ROM.

Since Emacs 19 is on the Lisps/Emacs Tape and the Source CD-ROM, a
subscription to either is an easy way to keep current with Emacs 19 as it
evolves.

A subscription is an easy way to keep up with the regular bug fixes to the X
Window System.	We update the X11R6 Required tape as fixes and patches are
issued throughout the year.  Each edition of the *Note Source Code CD-ROMs::,
also has updated sources for the required part of the X Window System.

Please note: In two cases, you must pay 4 times the normal shipping required
for a single order when you pay for each subscription.	If you're in Alaska,
Hawaii, or Puerto Rico you must add $20.00 for shipping for each
subscription.  If you're outside of U.S., Canada, and Puerto Rico, you must
add $80.00 for each subscription.  See "Unix and VMS Software" & "Shipping
Instructions" on the *note Free Software Foundation Order Form::..



The Deluxe Distribution
***********************

The Free Software Foundation has been asked repeatedly to create a package
that provides executables for all of our software.  Normally we offer only
sources.  In addition to providing binaries with the source code, the Deluxe
Distribution includes a complete set of our printed manuals and reference
cards.

The FSF Deluxe Distribution contains the binaries and sources to hundreds of
different programs including GNU Emacs, the GNU C Compiler, the GNU Debugger,
the complete X Window System, and all the GNU utilities.

We will make a Deluxe Distribution for most machines/operating systems.	 We
may be able to send someone to your office to do the compilation, if we can't
find a suitable machine close to us!  However, we can only compile the
programs that already support your chosen machine/system - porting is a
separate matter (to commission a port, consult the GNU Service Directory;
details in *Note Free Software Support::).  Compiling all these programs
takes time; a Deluxe Distribution for an unusual machine will take longer to
produce than one for a common machine.	Please contact the FSF Office with
any questions.

We supply the software in one of these tape formats in Unix `tar' format:
1600 or 6250bpi 1/2in reel, Sun DC300XLP 1/4in cartridge - QIC24,
Hewlett-Packard 16-track DC600HC 1/4in cartridge, IBM RS/6000 1/4in cartridge
- QIC 150, Exabyte 8mm cartridge, or DAT 4mm cartridge.	 If your computer
cannot read any of these, please contact us to see if we can handle your
format.

The manuals included are one each of the `Bison', `Calc', `Gawk', `GNU C
Compiler', `GNU C Library', `GDB', `Flex', `GNU Emacs Lisp Reference',
`Programming in Emacs Lisp: An Introduction', `Make', `Texinfo', & `Termcap'
manuals; six copies of the `GNU Emacs' manual; and a packet of ten reference
cards each for Emacs, Bison, Calc, Flex, & GDB.	  Every Deluxe Distribution
also has a copy of the latest editions of our CD-ROMs (including the MS-DOS &
Debian GNU/Linux Books with CD when they are available) that have sources of
our software & compiler tool binaries for some systems.	 The MS-DOS CD is in
ISO 9660 format.  The other CDs are in ISO 9660 format with Rock Ridge
extensions.

The price of the Deluxe Distribution is $5000 (shipping included).  These
sales provide enormous financial assistance to help the FSF develop more free
software.  To order, please fill out the "Deluxe Distribution" section on the
*note Free Software Foundation Order Form::.  and send it to:

GNU Documentation
*****************

GNU is dedicated to having quality, easy-to-use online & printed
documentation.	GNU manuals are intended to explain underlying concepts,
describe how to use all the features of each program, & give examples of
command use.  GNU manuals are distributed as Texinfo source files, which
yield both typeset hardcopy via the TeX document formatting system and online
hypertext display via the menu-driven Info system.  Source for these manuals
comes with our software; these are the manuals that we publish as printed
books as well.	See the *note Free Software Foundation Order Form::., to
order them.

Most GNU manuals are bound as soft cover books with "lay-flat" bindings.
This allows you to open them so they lie flat on a table without creasing the
binding.  They have an inner cloth spine and an outer cardboard cover that
will not break or crease as an ordinary paperback will.	 Currently, the
`GDB', `Emacs', `Emacs Lisp Reference', `Programming in Emacs Lisp: An
Introduction', `GAWK', `Make', `Bison', & `Texinfo' manuals have this
binding.  The other GNU manuals also lie flat when opened, using a GBC or
Wire-O binding.	 All our manuals are 7in by 9.25in except the 8.5in by 11in
`Calc' manual.

The edition number of the manual and version number of the program listed
after each manual's name were current at the time this Bulletin was published.

`Debugging with GDB' (Edition 4.12 for Version 4.14) tells how to use the GNU
Debugger, run your program under debugger control, examine and alter data,
modify a program's flow of control, and use GDB through GNU Emacs.

The `Emacs Manual' (11th Edition for Version 19.29) describes editing with
GNU Emacs.  It explains advanced features, including outline mode and regular
expression search; how to use special modes for programming in languages like
C++ and TeX; how to use the `tags' utility; how to compile and correct code;
how to make your own keybindings; and other elementary customizations.

`Programming in Emacs Lisp: An Introduction' (Edition 1.03) is for people who
are not necessarily interested in programming, but who do want to customize
or extend their computing environment.	If you read it in Emacs under Info
mode, you can run the sample programs directly.

The `GNU Emacs Lisp Reference Manual' (Edition 2.4 for Version 19.29) covers
this programming language in depth, including data types, control structures,
functions, macros, syntax tables, searching/matching, modes, windows,
keymaps, byte compilation, and the operating system interface.

The `GAWK Manual' (Edition 0.16 for Version 2.16) tells how to use the GNU
implementation of `awk'.  It is written for those who have never used `awk'
and describes the features of this powerful string and record manipulation
language.

The `Make Manual' (Edition 0.46 for Version 3.72) describes GNU `make', a
program used to rebuild parts of other programs.  The manual tells how to
write "makefiles", which specify how a program is to be compiled and how its
files depend on each other.  Included are an introductory chapter for novice
users and a section about automatically generated dependencies.

The `Flex Manual' (Edition 1.03 for Version 2.3.7) teaches you to write a
lexical scanner definition for the `flex' program to create a C++ or C-coded
scanner that recognizes the patterns defined.  You need no prior knowledge of
scanners.

The `Bison Manual' (December 1993 Edition for Version 1.23) teaches you how
to write context-free grammars for the Bison program that convert into
C-coded parsers.  You need no prior knowledge of parser generators.

`Using and Porting GNU CC' (September 1994 Edition for Version 2.6) tells how
to run, install, and port the GNU C Compiler to new systems.  It lists new
features and incompatibilities of GCC, but people not familiar with C will
still need a good reference on the C programming language.  It also covers
G++.  We are doing limited copier runs of this manual until it becomes more
stable.

The `Texinfo Manual' (Edition 2.21 for Version 3) explains the markup
language that produces our online Info documentation & typeset hardcopies.
It tells you how to make tables, lists, chapters, nodes, indexes, cross
references, & how to catch mistakes.  This second edition describes over 50
new commands.

The `Termcap Manual' (2nd Edition for Version 1.2), often described as "twice
as much as you ever wanted to know about termcap," details the format of the
termcap database, the definitions of terminal capabilities, and the process
of interrogating a terminal description.  This manual is primarily for
programmers.

The `C Library Reference Manual' (Edition 0.06 for Version 1.09) describes
most of the facilities of the GNU C library, including both what Unix calls
"library functions" and "system calls."	 We are doing limited copier runs of
this manual until it becomes more stable.  Please send corrections and
improvements to `bug-glibc-manual@prep.ai.mit.edu'.

The `Emacs Calc Manual' (Edition 2.02 for Version 2.02) is both a tutorial
and a reference manual.	 It tells how to do ordinary arithmetic, how to use
Calc for algebra, calculus, and other forms of mathematics, and how to extend
Calc.

How to Get GNU Software
***********************

All the software & publications from the Free Software Foundation are
distributed with permission to copy and redistribute.  One way to get GNU
software is to copy it from someone else who has it.  You can also get GNU
software directly from the FSF by ordering diskettes, tapes, CD-ROMs, or
Books with CD-ROMs.  Such orders provide most of the funds for the FSF staff
to develop more free software, so please support our work by ordering from
the FSF if you can.  See the *note Free Software Foundation Order Form::..

There are also third party groups who distribute our software; they do not
work with us, but can provide our software in other forms.  Some are listed
in *Note Free Software for Microcomputers::; also see *Note Free Software
Redistributors Donate::.  Please note that the Free Software Foundation is
*not* affiliated with them in any way and is *not* responsible for either the
currency of their versions or the swiftness of their responses.

If you decide to do business with a commercial distributor of free software,
ask them how much they do to assist free software development, e.g., by
contributing money to free software development projects or by writing free
software themselves for general use.  By basing your decision partially on
this factor, you can help encourage support for free software development.

Our main FTP host is very busy & limits the number of logins.  Please use one
of these other Internet sites that also provide GNU software via FTP
(program: `ftp', user: `anonymous', password: YOUR E-MAIL ADDRESS, mode:
`binary').  If you have FTP access but can't reach one of these hosts, you
can get the software the same way from GNU's main FTP host, `prep.ai.mit.edu'
(IP address: `18.159.0.42').  For more details & additional hosts, get the
files `/pub/gnu/GETTING.GNU.SOFTWARE' and `/pub/gnu/GNUinfo/FTP'.

Most of the files on the FTP sites are compressed with `gzip' to lessen FTP
traffic.  Refer to the `/pub/gnu/=README-about-.gz-files' on each FTP site
for instructions on uncompressing them.	 `uncompress' and `unpack' *do not
work*!

Free Software for Microcomputers
********************************

We do not provide support for GNU software on most microcomputers because it
is peripheral to the GNU Project.  However, we are willing to publish
information about groups who do support and maintain them.  If you are aware
of any such efforts, please send the details, including postal addresses,
archive sites, and mailing lists, to either address on page 1.

*Note MS-DOS Diskettes:: and *Note CD-ROMs::, for microcomputer software
available from the FSF.	 Please do not ask us about any other software.	 We
do *not* maintain any of it and have *no* additional information.

   * Linux     (Also *note Debian GNU/Linux Book with CD-ROM::.)

     Linux (named after its main author, Linus Torvalds) is a GPLed kernel
     that implements POSIX.1 functionality with SysV & BSD extensions.
     Complete systems (essentially variant GNU systems) based on the Linux
     kernel are now available for 386/486/Pentium machines with one of these
     buses: ISA, VLB, EISA, PCI.  Since these systems are essentially variant
     GNU systems, we call them "GNU/Linux" systems.  A m68k port is in
     testing (it runs on high end Amiga & Atari computers).  AlphaPC & MIPS
     ports are being worked on.	 FTP it from `tsx-11.mit.edu' in `/pub/linux'
     (USA) & `nic.funet.fi' in `/pub/OS/Linux' (Europe).   Ask
     `linux-activists-request@niksula.hut.fi' about mailing lists.  See the
     USENET newsgroups, such as `comp.os.linux.misc', for discussions.

   * Boston Computer Society

     The BCS has numerous free programs for microcomputers, including some GNU
     programs.	Contact them to see what is available for your machine:

     on Emacs 19.  You can get more info from a GNU FTP host (listed in *Note
     How to Get GNU Software::) in file `/pub/gnu/MicrosPorts/Amiga'.

   * GNU Software for Atari TOS and Atari Minix

     Get Atari ports by anonymous FTP from `atari.archive.umich.edu', in
     `/atari/Gnustuff', maintained by Howard Chu, `howard@lloyd.com'.  The
     GNU software runs on all Atari 68000 and 68030-based systems; a hard
     drive and 4 MB RAM minimum are recommended for using the compilers.  See
     USENET newsgroups, such as `comp.sys.atari.st.tech', for discussions.

   * GNU Software for OS/2

     Ports of many GNU programs are on the FTP host `ftp-os2.cdrom.com' in
     `/pub/os2/unix'.  One of these is of GNU C/C++/Objective-C Compiler to
     OS/2 2.x and OS/2 Warp, with the GNU assembler, documentation, and both
     OS/2-specific BSD C libraries.   This is Eberhard Mattes `emx' port,
     which also features GDB and many Unix-related library functions like
     `fork'.  Programs compiled by this port also run on a 80386 under DOS.
     It is in directory `/pub/os2/unix/emx09a'.	 The `emx0.9a' package offers
     a port of gcc-2.6.3.  To join the mailing list send email to
     `listserv@eb.ele.tue.nl' containing `sub emx-list firstname lastname'.



FSF T-shirt
***********

Our latest T-shirt has artwork by Berkeley, CA artist Etienne Suvasa.  The
front has the ever-popular picture of GNArnold from the `Flex Manual', while
the back has the Preamble to the GNU General Public License.

They are available in two colors, Natural & Black.  Natural is an off-white,
unbleached, undyed, environment-friendly cotton, printed with black ink, & is
great for tye-dyeing or displaying as is.  Black is printed with white ink &
is perfect for late night hacking.  All shirts are thick 100% cotton, & are
available in sizes M, L, XL, & XXL.  This shirt makes a great gift for your
favorite hacker!

Project GNU Wish List
*********************

Wishes for this issue are for:

   * Graphical free software applications for ordinary users who are not
     programmers.  Oleo extensions and other free software for business, such
     as accounting and project management programs.

   * Volunteers to distribute this Bulletin at technical conferences, trade
     shows, local and national user group meetings, etc.  Volunteers to get
     articles into their user group newsletters.  Please phone or fax the
     numbers on page 1, or email `gnu@prep.ai.mit.edu' to make arrangements.

   * Boston area volunteers for various tasks in the FSF Distribution and
     Programming Offices.  Please contact us at either address on page 1.

   * Volunteers to help write programs and documentation.  Send mail to
     `gnu@prep.ai.mit.edu' for the task list and coding standards.

   * Volunteers to build binaries for systems not yet on the *Note Compiler
     Tools Binaries CD-ROM:: (especially for systems that don't come with a C
     compiler).	 Please contact us at either address on page 1.

   * SCSI tape drives for 4mm DAT cartridge tapes, 8mm Exabyte cartridge
     tapes, and 1600 or 6250bpi 1/2inch reel to reel tapes.

   * 600+ megabyte SCSI disks to give us more space to develop software.

   * Pentium, 486, or 386 PC laptops.

   * Pentium, 486, or 386 PC compatibles with 200+ MB of disk & Ethernet
     cards.  High end HP-300, HP-700, & HP-800 workstations.  Sun
     SPARCstations.  Sixteen or thirty-two 1 Meg SIMMs for a Sun 4/110.

   * Companies to lend good programmers & technical writers for at least six
     months.  True wizards may be welcome for less time, but we have found
     that this is the minimum time for a programmer to finish a worthwhile
     project.

   * Professors who might be interested in sponsoring or hosting research
     assistants to do actual GNU development, with partial FSF support.

   * Speech and character recognition software and systems (if the devices
     aren't too weird), with the device drivers if possible.  This would help
     the productivity of partially disabled people (including a few we know).

   * New quotes and ideas for articles in the GNU's Bulletin.  We particularly
     like to highlight organizations involved with free information exchanges,
     software that uses the GNU General Public License and companies providing
     free software support as a primary business.

   * Information about free software or developers of free software that we
     may not know about.  Often, we only find out about interesting projects
     because a user writes and asks us why we have not mentioned those
     projects!

   * Copies of newspaper and journal articles mentioning the GNU Project or
     GNU software.  Send these to the address on page 1, or send a citation
     to `gnu@prep.ai.mit.edu'.

   * Money.   If you use & appreciate our software, please send a
     contribution.  One way to help is to order a tape, diskette, CD-ROM, or
     Book with CD-ROM from us.	A business can make a larger contribution by
     ordering a *Note Deluxe Distribution::.  This is especially helpful if
     you work for an organization where the word "donation" is anathema.
     Because of the value received, the full dollar amounts of such donations
     are not tax deductible as charitable contributions; however, they may
     qualify as a business expense.
