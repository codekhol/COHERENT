This is an incomplete and probably out-of-date list of all the packages
distributed on prep.ai.mit.edu with a brief description explaining what
each one is.

More information about these programs can typically be found in the GNU
Bulletin.  To receive a copy, write to gnu@prep.ai.mit.edu.

Problems with the contents of this file (or problems pertaining to the
packaging of these programs, e.g. if a file is corrupted) should be sent to
friedman@prep.ai.mit.edu.  Bug reports for the programs themselves should
go to the appropriate address indicated in the instructions to that
program.

Because the unix `compress' utility is patented (by two separate patents,
in fact), we cannot use it; it's not free software.  Therefore, the GNU
Project has chosen a new compression utility, `gzip', which is free of any
known software patents and which tends to compress better anyway.  Files
compressed with this new compression program end in `.z' (as opposed to
`compress'-compressed files, which end in `.Z').  Gzip can uncompress
`compress'-compressed files and SVR4 `pack' files (which also end in `.z').
This is possible because the various decompression algorithms are not
patented---only compression is.

The gzip program is available from any GNU mirror site in shar, tar, or
gzipped tar format (for those who already have a prior version of gzip and
want faster data transmission).  It works on virtually every unix system,
MSDOS, OS/2, and VMS.

Filenames below ending with "/" are directories.  Other entries are plain

COPYING-1.0
   Version 1 of the GNU General Public License.


COPYING-2.0
   Version 2 of the GNU General Public License.


COPYING.LIB-2.0
   Version 2 of the GNU General Public Library License (there is no
   version 1).


GNUinfo/
   General files of interest about the GNU Project, most of them included in
   the GNU Emacs distribution.


MailingListArchives/
   Archives of the GNU mailing lists (most of which are also gatewayed to
   the various gnu.* newsgroups).


MicrosPorts/
   The GNU Project is not directly interested in integrating or
   maintaining ports of GNU software to many micro-computer systems, like
   Amiga's or MSDOS, because of limited resources.  However, a few files
   with pointers to people who do maintain GNU software for these other
   systems are available in this directory.


ae.tar.z
   This is a complicated profiling system that works with GCC to produce
   more complete profiling information.  Instructions for compiling `ae'
   are in the files "README" and "INSTALL".


autoconf-1.3.tar.z
   Autoconf is an extensible package of m4 macros that creates a
   non-interactive configuration script for a package from a template
   file.  The template file lists the operating system features that the
   package can use, in the form of m4 macro calls, and can also contain
   arbitrary shell commands.  Autoconf requires GNU m4.
   
   Autoconf-generated configure scripts are being used by many GNU
   packages currently, and will be used by more in the future.


bash-1.12.tar.z
   BASH (the Bourne Again SHell) is a Posix-compatable shell with full
   Bourne shell (`sh') syntax and some C-shell commands.  BASH supports
   emacs-style command-line editing, job control, functions, and on-line
   help.  Instructions for compiling BASH may be found in the file
   "README".


bc-1.02.tar.z
   `bc' is an interactive algebraic language with arbitrary precision.
   GNU `bc' was implemented from the POSIX 1003.2 draft standard, but it
   has several extensions including multi-character variable names, an
   `else' statement, and full Boolean expressions.
   
   GNU `bc' does not use the historical method of being a compiler for
   the `dc' calculator.  This version has a single executable that both
   compiles the language and runs the resulting "byte code".  The "byte
   code" is NOT the `dc' language.
   
   Instructions for compiling `bc' are in the file "Install".


binutils-1.9.tar.z
   The binutils comprise several small programs that are useful when
   dealing with compiled programs.  They include `ar', `ld' (the linker),
   `nm', `size', `strip', and `gprof'.  The programs support BSD
   (Berkeley) format binary files, as well as COFF-encapsulation (BSD
   format with a wrapper to allow you to run the binaries on COFF
   systems).  Read the file "README" for instructions on compiling these
   programs.


binutils-2.1.tar.z
   This is a beta release of a completely rewritten binutils
   distribution.  These programs have been tested on various
   architectures.  Most recently tested are sun3 and sun4s running
   sunos4, as well as Sony News running newsos3.  However, since this is
   a beta release taken directly from an evolving source tree, there
   might be some problems.  In particular, the programs have not been
   ported to as many machines as the old binutils.  There are also
   features of the old versions that are missing on the new programs.  We
   would appreciate patches to make things run on other machines;
   especially welcome are fixes for what used to work on the old
   programs!
   
   This release contains the following programs: `ar', `demangle', `ld'
   (the linker), `nm', `objdump', `ranlib', `size', `strip', and `gprof'.
   
   BFD (the Binary File Descripter) library is in the subdirectory `bfd'
   and is built along with GDB (which uses bfd).
   
   See the "README" file for further instructions on where to look for
   building the various utilities.


bison-1.19.tar.z
   Bison is an upwardly compatible replacement for the parser generator
   `yacc', with more features.  The file "README" gives instructions for
   compiling Bison; the files `bison.1' (a man page) and `bison.texinfo'
   (a GNU Texinfo file) give instructions for using it.


calc-2.02.tar.z
   Calc is an extensible, advanced desk calculator and mathematical tool
   that runs as part of GNU Emacs.  It comes with source for the Calc
   Manual, which serves as a tutorial and reference.  If you wish, you
   can use Calc only as a simple four-function calculator, but it
   provides additional features including choice of algebraic or RPN
   (stack-based) entry, logarithmic functions, trigonometric and
   financial functions, arbitrary precision, complex numbers, vectors,
   matrices, dates, times, infinities, sets, algebraic simplification,
   differentiation, and integration.  Instructions for install Calc for
   emacs are in the "README" file.


cperf-2.1.tar.z
   This is a program to generate minimally perfect hash functions for
   sets of keywords.  GCC was optimized by using this program.  Other
   programs that must recognize a set of keywords may also benefit from
   using this program.  Instructions for compiling cperf may be found in
   the file "README".  Note that a C++ version of cperf (called `gperf')
   is included in the libg++ distribution.  This version is for the use
   of people who do not want to install C++ in order to compile a single
   program.


cpio-2.2.tar.z
   `cpio' is a program for creating, updating, and extracting archives.
   GNU `cpio' supports the final POSIX 1003.1 "ustar" standard.
   Instructions for compiling `cpio' are in the file "README".


cvs-1.3.tar.z
   CVS is a collection of programs that provide for software release and
   revision control functions.  CVS is designed to work on top of RCS
   version 4.  It will parse older RCS formats, but cannot use any of its
   fancier features without RCS branch support.  The file "README"
   contains more information about CVS.


dclshar
   Makes a shar-type .COM file for VAX/VMS systems, so it's possble to
   transfer whole filesystem heirarchies back and forth.


dejagnu-0.9.tar.z
   DejaGnu is a framework for testing other programs.  Its purpose is to
   provide a single front end for all tests.  For more information read
   the "README" file.


diff-2.2.tar.z
   `diff' compares files showing line-by-line changes in several flexible
   formats.  GNU `diff' is much faster than the traditional Unix
   versions.  This distribution includes `diff', `diff3', `sdiff', and
   `cmp'.  Instructions for compiling these are in the "README" file.


dirent.tar.z
   A freely-redistributable implementation of the dirent library
   routines.  This release predates the GNU C library, which is more
   complete.


dld-3.2.3.tar.z
   Dld is a library package of C functions that performs "dynamic link
   editing".  Programs that use dld can add compiled object code to or
   remove such code from a process anytime during its execution.  Loading
   modules, searching libraries, resolving external references, and
   allocating storage for global and static data structures are all
   performed at run time.
   
   Dld works on VAX, Sun 3, SPARCstation, Sequent Symmetry, and Atari ST
   machines.


ecc-1.2.1.tar.z
   ECC is a Reed-Solomon error correction checking program.  It is
   capable of correcting three byte errors in a block of 255 bytes, and
   is capable of detecting more severe errors.


elib-0.06.tar.z
   This is a small library of emacs-lisp functions.


elisp-manual-1.03.tar.z
   This is the GNU Emacs Lisp Reference manual with texinfo source and a
   DVI file that's ready for printing.  A copy of `makeinfo' is also
   provided so that you can make an online version of the manual.  The
   manual documents the extension language used by GNU Emacs.


elvis-1.7.tar.z
   Elvis is a clone of vi/ex, the standard UNIX editor.  It supports
   nearly all of the vi/ex commands, in both visual mode and colon mode.
   Elvis runs under BSD UNIX, AT&T SysV UNIX, SCO Xenix, Minix, MS-DOS,
   Atari TOS, and probably others.  Directions for building elvis are in
   the "README" file.


emacs-18.59.tar.z
   GNU Emacs is an extensible, customizable fullscreen editor.  Read the
   files "README" and "INSTALL" for a full description of the parts of
   GNU Emacs, and the steps needed to install it.  This distribution
   includes the complete GNU Emacs Manual.


f2c-3.2.90.tar.z
   This is a Fortran-to-C converter program.  Instructions for compiling
   it are in the file "src/README".


fax-3.2.1.tar.z
   This is a set of software which provides Group 3 fax transmission and
   reception services for a networked unix system.  It requires a
   faxmodem which conforms to the new EIA-592 Asynchronous Facsimile DCE
   Control Standard, Service Class 2.


fgrep-1.1.tar.z
   `fgrep' is a simplified version of `grep' which only searches for
   literal text rather than regular expressions.  Eventually GNU `fgrep'
   will disappear into the single grep program mandated by POSIX, but for
   now it should be a compatible replacement for UNIX fgrep.  The options
   are the same as those of GNU `egrep', and are a proper superset of the
   fgrep options on all UNIX systems we are aware of.  Instructions for
   building fgrep are in the "Makefile" and "README" file.


fileutils-3.4.tar.z
   These are the GNU file-manipulation utilities.  Instructions for
   compiling these utilities are in the file "README".  The fileutils
   package contains the following programs: chgrp chmod chown cp dd df
   dir du ginstall ln ls mkdir mkfifo mknod mv rm rmdir touch vdir.


find-3.8.tar.z
   This is a posix-compliant implementation (with many extensions) of
   `find', a program used for searching filesystems for files that match
   certain criteria and performing operations (like showing the path)
   when they are found.  Also included in this distribution are `xargs'
   and `locate'.


finger-1.37.tar.z
   GNU Finger is a utility program designed to allow users of Unix hosts
   on the Internet network to get information about each other.  It is a
   direct replacement for the Berkeley 4.3 `finger' program, although it
   produces different looking output.  For more information about why,
   read "finger-1.37/doc/finger.texinfo".  Instructions for building
   finger itself are in the "README" file.


flex-2.3.8.tar.z
   This is a faster, but not completely compatible replacement for `lex',
   a lexical-analyzer-compiler.  Instructions for compiling `flex' are in
   the file "README".


fontutils-0.6.tar.z
   These are the GNU font utilities.  There are various programs for
   converting between various bitmaps and other graphical data formats,
   creating fonts using Ghostscript, and other frobnicating utilities.
   You will need GCC and GNU Make to compile these programs.  For the
   programs which do online graphics, you will need an X11 server and the
   X11R4 or R5 libraries.  Instructions for building the fontutils are in
   the "README" file.


g++-1.42.0.tar.z
   This is the old source to the GNU C++ compiler, G++.  Note that g++ version
   1 is separate from GCC version 1, but in version 2 both programs are
   merged.  Instructions for compilation of this program are in the file
   "README".
   
   The maintainers of g++ recommend use of the 2.x version of g++, as the 1.x
   version is no longer being maintained.


gas-1.38.1.tar.z
   GAS is the GNU assembler.  GAS includes several features designed to
   optimize the output of a C compiler.  In particular, it automatically
   chooses the correct size for branch instructions (when it knows where
   it is branching to), and automatically modifies jump-table entries
   that are out-of-bounds.  GAS works on the VAX, the 68020, the 80386,
   and the 320xx.  Read the file "README" for instructions on building
   and using GAS.


gas-2.0.tar.z
   GAS is the GNU assembler.  Version 2 has many changes over previous
   GAS releases.  Most notable among the changes are the separation of
   host system, target CPU, and target file format (i.e. cross-assembling
   is much easier).  Many CPU types and object file formats are now
   supported.
   
   Read the file "gas-2.0/gas/README" for instructions on building
   and using GAS.


gawk-2.14.tar.z
   This version of GNU AWK is upwardly-compatible with the SVR4 version.
   Read the file "README" for instructions on compiling GAWK.
   Instructions for using GAWK are in the file "gawk.texinfo".


gcc-1.42.tar.z
   The GNU C compiler is a fairly portable optimizing compiler.  It
   supports full ANSI C.  It generates good code for the 32000, 680x0,
   80386, Alliant, Convex, Tahoe, and Vax CPUs, and for these RISC CPUs:
   i860, Pyramid, Sparc, and SPUR.  The MIPS RISC CPU is also supported.
   Machines using these CPUs include 386 running AIX, Alliant FX/8, Altos
   3068, Apollo 68000/68020 running Aegis, AT&T 3B1, Convex C1 and C2,
   DECstation 3100, DECstation 5000, DEC VAX, Encore MultiMax (NS32000),
   Genix NS32000, Harris HCX-7 and HCX-9, HP-UX 68000/68020, HP running
   BSD, IBM PS/2 running AIX, Intel 386 (System V, Xenix, BSD, but not
   MS-DOS), Iris MIPS machine, ISI 68000/68020, MIPS, NeXT, Pyramid,
   Sequent Balance (NS32000), Sequent Symmetry (i386), SONY News, Sun 2,
   Sun 3 (optionally with FPA), Sun 4, SparcStation, and Sun386i.


gcc-2.3.3.tar.z
   This is version 2 of GCC, the GNU C Compiler.  In addition to
   supporting ANSI C, GCC Version 2 includes support for the C++ and
   Objective C languages.
   
   GCC extends the C language to support nested functions, non-local
   gotos, taking the address of program labels, and unnamed structures as
   function arguments (among other things).  There are also many new
   warnings for frequent programming mistakes.
   
   GCC 2 can generate output files in a.out, COFF, ECOFF, ELF, XCOFF,
   VAX-VMS and OSF-Rose formats when used with a suitable assembler.  It
   can produce debugging information in several formats: BSD stabs, COFF,
   ECOFF, ECOFF with stabs symbols, VAX-VMS and DWARF.  (We may support
   XCOFF for the RS/6000 in the future.)
   
   GCC can be easily configured as a cross-compiler, running on one
   platform while generating code for another.
   
   GCC Version 2 supports compatible calling conventions for function
   calling and return values on the Sparc (unlike version 1) as well as
   the other machine types.
   
   Early testing of GCC Version 2 indicates that it produces faster code
   for SPARC computers than Sun's latest released compilers (both bundled
   and unbundled).  It is also the fastest known compiler for the
   Motorola 88k.
   
   GCC Version 2 can produce position-independent code for several types
   of CPU: 68000, 88000, 80386, Sparc, and RS/6000.  Supporting PIC on
   additional suitable CPU types is not too difficult a task.
   
   A list of supported systems and instructions for compiling GCC are in
   the file "INSTALL".


gdb-4.8.tar.z
   This is the GNU source-level debugger.  A list of the machines
   supported as targets or hosts, as well as a list of new features,
   appears in "gdb-4.8/gdb/NEWS".
   
   Instructions for compiling GDB are in the file "gdb-4.8/gdb/README".
   
   BFD (the Binary File Descripter) library is in the subdirectory `bfd' and
   is built along with GDB (which uses it).


gdbm-1.5.tar.z
   This is the beta-test version of the gnu DBM library.  See the file
   "README" for details.


ghostscript-2.5.2.tar.z
   This program is an interpreter for a language that is intended to be,
   and very nearly is, compatible with the PostScript language.  It runs
   under X on Unix and VMS systems, and also runs on MS-DOS machines.  It
   will drive either displays or low-to-medium-resolution printers.
   Instructions for compiling Ghostscript are in the file "README".
   Fonts for Ghostscript are in the directory "ghostscript-2.5.2/fonts".


ghostview-1.4.1.tar.z
   Ghostview allows you to view PostScript(TM) files on X11 displays.
   Ghostview handles the user interface details and calls the
   `ghostscript' interpreter to render the image.  Instructions for
   compiling ghostview are in the "README" file.


glibc-1.05.1.tar.z
   This directory contains a test release of the GNU C Library.  Some
   bugs surely remain.
   
   The library is ANSI C-1989 and POSIX 1003.1-1990 compliant and has most
   of the functions specified in POSIX 1003.2 draft 11.2.  It is upward
   compatible with the 4.4 BSD C library and includes many System V
   functions, plus GNU extensions.
   
   Version 1.05.1 uses a standard GNU `configure' script and runs on
   Sun-3 & Sun-4 (SunOS 4.1), HP 9000/300 & Sony NEWS 800 (4.3 BSD), MIPS
   DECstation (Ultrix 4.2), and i386/i486 (System V & BSD).  The port to
   the i386 running either SVR3, SVR4, or BSD, is mostly complete but has
   not been well tested.  Porting the library is not hard.  If you are
   interested in doing a port, please get on the mailing list by sending
   electronic mail to bug-glibc-request@prep.ai.mit.edu.
   
   GNU stdio lets you define new kinds of streams, just by writing a few
   C functions.  `fmemopen' function uses this to open a stream on a
   string, which can grow as necessary.  You can define your own `printf'
   formats to use a C function you have written.  Also, you can safely
   use format strings from user input to implement a `printf'-like
   function for another programming language, for example.  Extended
   `getopt' functions are already used to parse options, including long
   options, in many GNU utilities.
   
   See the file "INSTALL" for instructions on building the library.


glibc-crypt-1.05.tar.z
   The GNU C library now includes Michael Glad's Ultra Fast Crypt, which
   provides the Unix `crypt' function, plus some other entry points.
   Because of the United States export restriction on DES
   implementations, we are distributing this code separately from the
   rest of the C library.  There is an extra distribution tar file just
   for crypt; it is called `glibc-crypt-1.05.tar.z'.  You can just unpack
   the crypt distribution along with the rest of the C library and build;
   you can also build the library without getting crypt.  Users outside
   the USA can get the crypt distribution via anonymous FTP from
   ftp.uni-c.dk [129.142.6.74], or another archive site outside the USA.
   Archive maintainers are encouraged to copy this distribution to their
   archives outside the USA.  Please get it from ftp.uni-c.dk;
   transferring this distribution from prep.ai.mit.edu (or any other site
   in the USA) to a site outside the USA is in violation of US export
   laws.


gmp-1.2.tar.z
   GNU MP is a library for arbitrary precision arithmetic, operating on
   signed integers and rational numbers.  It has a rich set of functions,
   and the functions have a regular interface.  Instructions for using
   and compiling the MP library are in the file "INSTALL".


gnats-3.00.tar.z
   GNATS (GNats: A Tracking System) is a bug-tracking system.  It is
   based upon the paradigm of a central site or organization which
   receives problem reports and negotiates their resolution by electronic
   mail.  Although it's been used primarily as a software bug-tracking
   system so far, it is sufficiently generalized so that it could be used
   for handling system administration issues, project management, or any
   number of other applications.


gnuchess-4.0.pl61.tar.z
   This is a chess playing program with X, Suntools, curses, ASCII, and
   IBMPC character set displays available.  Instructions for compiling
   and using GNUchess may be found in the "README" file.


gnugo-1.1.tar.z
   This program plays the game of "Go".  Instructions for compiling it
   are in the file "README".


gnuplot-3.2.tar.z
   Gnuplot is an interactive program for plotting mathematical
   expressions and data.  Oddly enough, this program was neither done for
   nor named for the GNU Project---the name is a coincidence.


gptx-0.2.tar.z
   This is an alpha release of the GNU version of a permuted index
   generator.  Among other things, it can produce a readable "KWIC"
   (KeyWords In their Context) without the need of `nroff'.  There is
   also an option to produce TeX compatible output.  Instructions for
   compiling gptx are in the file "README".


graphics-0.17.tar.z
   The GNU graphics utilities are a set of programs for producing plot
   files and displaying them on Tektronix 4010, PostScript, and X window
   system compatible output devices.  It includes replacements for the
   `graph' and `plot' commands commonly supplied with some operating
   systems.  Instructions for compiling the graphics utilities are in the
   file "Makefile".


grep-1.6.tar.z
   This is the GNU high-speed `grep' program.  It is similar to its Unix
   counterpart, but it is usually faster.  Instructions for compiling it
   are in the file "README".


groff-1.07.tar.z
   This is the GNU 'roff document formatting system.  Included in this
   release are implementations of `troff', `pic', `eqn', `tbl', the
   `-man' and `-ms' macros, and drivers for PostScript, TeX dvi format,
   and typewriter-like devices.  Also included is a modified version of
   the Berkeley `-me' macros, and an enhanced version of the X11R4
   `xditview'.


gzip-1.0.7.shar
gzip-1.0.7.tar
gzip-1.0.7.tar.z
   This is a new compression program free of known patents which the GNU
   Project is using instead of the traditional `compress' program (which
   has patent problems).  Gzip can uncompress LZW-compressed files but
   uses a different algorithm for compression which generally yields
   smaller compressed files.  This will be the standard compression
   program in the GNU system.


hello-1.1.tar.z
   The GNU `hello' program produces a familiar, friendly greeting.  It
   allows nonprogrammers to use a classic computer science tool which
   would otherwise be unavailable to them.  Because it is protected by
   the GNU General Public License, users are free to share and change it.


indent-1.7.tar.z
   This is the GNU modified version of the freely-distributable `indent'
   program from BSD.  The file "indent.texinfo" contains instructions on
   using indent.


ispell-2.0.02.tar.z
   Ispell is an interactive spelling corrector based on the ITS SPELL
   program.


less-177.tar.z
   Less is a paginator similiar to `more' and `pg', but with various
   features (such as the ability to scroll backwards) that some other
   pagers lack.  Instructions for compiling `less' are in the file
   "README".


libg++-1.39.0.tar.z
   This is the GNU C++ Library, a collection of C++ classes and support
   tools for use with the GNU C++ compiler.  This includes a copy of the
   `gperf' program that is written in C++ (see also the description of
   `cperf').


libg++-2.3.tar.z
   This is the GNU C++ library, a collection of C++ classes and support
   tools for use with the GNU C++ compiler.  Other features include:
   
   * Uses new iostream classes to replace the old stream classes.  The
     new design is mostly compatible with AT&T's version 2.x iostream
     classes, though some features have not been implemented yet, and
     there are a number of extensions.  The iostream library will track
     the ANSI C++ standardization effort.
   
     The new iostream classes are more extensible that earlier designs:
     There is a (reasonably) well-defined protocol for writing new
     streambufs (character sources and sinks) at the application level;
     some have already been written, others are planned.
   
     There is also a fairly complete implementation of C stdio built on
     *top* of streambuf (where FILE==streambuf).  This provides 100%
     compatibility between C and C++ I/O.  It is not installed by
     default.
   
   * Include files no longer hard-wire in C header files. (I.e.
     g++-include/signal.h uses the gcc 2 #include_next feature instead of
     #include "/usr/include/signal.h".)  This should make it easier to
     combine g++ headers with non-standard libraries (such as the
     recently-released GNU C library).
   
   Instructions for building the g++ class library and other tools is in
   the file "libg++-2.3/libg++/README".


m4-1.0.3.tar.z
   `m4' is a macro processor, in the sense that in copies its input to
   the output, expanding macros as it goes.  Macros are either built-in
   or user-defined, and can take any number of arguments.  Besides just
   doing macro expansion, `m4' has built-in functions for including named
   files, running Unix commands, doing integer arithmetic, manipulating
   text in various ways, recursion, etc.  Instructions for building m4
   are in the "README" file.


make-3.63.tar.z
   This is GNU Make.  GNU Make supports many more options and features
   than the Unix make.  Instructions for using GNU Make are in the file
   "make.texinfo".  See the file "README" for installation instructions. 


mm-1.07.tar.z
   This is a macro package for groff.  It is supposed to be compatible
   with the DWB `mm' macros, and has several extensions.  See the "README"
   file for more details.


ms-0.06.tar.z
   This is MandelSpawn, a parallel Mandelbrot program for the X window
   system.  Instructions for compiling it are in the "README" files in
   each of the three subdirectories.


mtools-2.0.7.tar.z
   Mtools is a public domain collection of programs to allow Unix systems
   to read, write, and manipulate files on an MSDOS filesystem (typically
   a diskette).


nethack-3.1.tar.z
   This is the famous game of `nethack'.  Instructions for compiling and
   using nethack may be found in the "README" file.


nihcl-3.0.tar.z
   This is an object oriented program support class library with a
   portable collection of classes similar to those in Smalltalk-80.  This
   library used to be known as OOPS (Object-Oriented Program Support).


oleo-1.2.2.tar.z
   Oleo is a spreadsheet program (better for you than the more expensive
   spreadsheet).  It supports X windows and character-based terminals,
   and can generate embedded PostScript renditions of spreadsheets.
   Keybindings should be familiar to Emacs users and are configurable by
   users.
   
   There is relatively little documentation for Oleo yet.  The file
   "USING" contains what there is.


patch-2.0.12g8.tar.z
patch-2.0.12u8.tar.z
   `patch' will take a patch file containing any of the four forms of
   difference listing produced by the `diff' program and apply those
   differences to an original file, producing a patched version.
   Instructions for building patch are in the "README" file.


perl-4.036.tar.z
   This is version 4.036 of Larry Wall's perl programming language.
   Perl is intended as a faster replacement for sed, awk, and similar
   languages.  The file "README" contains instructions for compiling
   perl.


rcs-5.6.0.1.tar.z
   This is the Revision Control System, a program to manage multiple
   versions of a software project.  This program keeps the changes from
   one version to another rather than multiple copies of the entire file;
   this saves disk space.  Instructions for compiling RCS are in the file
   "README".


readline-1.1.tar.z
   The GNU Readline Library, which aids in the consistency of user
   interface across discrete programs than need to provide a command line
   interface.  Supports both emacs and vi-style editing.
   
   This release is pretty old; newer versions with more bug fixes are
   usually distributed with GDB and BASH.


recode-3.2.4.tar.z
   `recode' converts files between character sets and usages.  When exact
   transliterations are not possible, it may get rid of the offending
   characters or fall back on approximations.  It recognizes or produces
   a little more than a dozen of character sets and can convert each
   charset to almost any other one.  `recode' pays special attention to
   superimposition of diacritics, particularily for French.


regex-0.11.tar.z
   The GNU regexp library routines.  This release is probably out of
   date; newer versions of these routines are typically distributed along
   with programs which use them.


screen-3.2b.tar.z
   `screen' is a window manager that allows you to handle several
   independent screens (UNIX ttys) on a single physical terminal; each
   screen has its own set of processes connected to it (typically
   interactive shells).  Each virtual terminal created by `screen'
   emulates a DEC VT100 plus several ANSI X3.64 and ISO 2022 functions
   (including DEC VT102 features such as line and character deletion and
   insertion).  See the "README" file for details on compiling screen.


sed-1.13.tar.z
   `sed' is a text editor much like `ed', but is stream-oriented.  It is
   used copiously in shell scripts.  Although GNU sed has fewer static
   limitations in terms of buffer size, command length, etc., it is a
   little slower than most implementations.
   
   Instructions for building GNU sed are in the file "README".


shellutils-1.8.tar.z
   These are the GNU shell utilities, comprising small commands that are
   frequently run on the command line or in shell scripts.  Instructions
   for compiling these utilities are in the file "README".  The
   shellutils package contains the following programs: basename date
   dirname echo env expr false groups id logname nice nohup pathchk
   printenv printf sleep stty su tee test true tty uname who whoami yes.


smalltalk-1.1.1.tar.z
   This is the GNU implementation of Smalltalk, an object-oriented
   programming language.  Instructions for compiling it are in the file
   "README".


sparc-sun-solaris2/
   This directory contains binaries for various programs for the SPARC
   architecture running Solaris 2.0 or higher.  They will *not* work with
   SunOS 4.1.3 or earlier.
   
   These binaries are here because the C compiler was unbundled in
   Solaris 2.x.  We are not making a commitment to provide binaries for
   anything else, or even for Solaris, in the future.


superopt-2.2.tar.z
   The superoptimizer is a function sequence generator that uses a
   exhaustive generate-and-test approach to find the shortest instruction
   sequence for a given function.
   
   The GNU superoptimizer and its application in GCC is described in the
   ACM SIGPLAN PLDI'92 proceedings.


tar-1.11.2.shar.z
tar-1.11.2.tar.z
   Tar is a program used for archiving many files in a single file, which
   makes them easier to transport.
   
   GNU tar includes multivolume support, the ability to archive sparse
   files, automatic archive compression/decompression, remote archives,
   and special features to allow tar to be used for incremental and full
   backups.  Unfortunately GNU tar implements an early draft of the POSIX
   1003.1 `ustar standard which is different from the final standard.
   Adding support for the new changes in a backward-compatible fashion is
   not trivial.
   
   Instructions for compiling GNU tar may be found in the file `README'.


termcap-1.1.tar.z
   This is a standalone release of the GNU Termcap library, which has
   been part of the GNU Emacs distribution for years but is now available
   separately to make it easier to install as `libtermcap.a'.  The GNU
   Termcap library does not place an arbitrary limit on the size of
   termcap entries, unlike most other termcap libraries.  Included is
   extensive documentation in Texinfo format.  Unfortunately, this
   release does not have a termcap database included.  Instructions for
   building the termcap library are in the "README" file.


texinfo-2.16.tar.z
   This package contains a set of utilities related to Texinfo, which is
   used to generate printed manuals and online hypertext-style manuals
   (called `info').  Programs and interfaces for writing, reading, and
   formatting texinfo files are available both as standalone programs and
   as GNU Emacs interfaces.  See the file "README" for directions on how
   to use the various parts of this package.


textutils-1.4.tar.z
   These are the GNU text utilities, commands that are used to operate on
   textual data.  Instructions for compiling these utilities are in the
   file "README".  The textutils package contains the following programs:
   cat cksum comm csplit cut expand fold head join nl od paste pr sort
   split sum tac tail tr unexpand uniq wc.


tile-forth-2.1.tar.z
   TILE Forth is a 32-bit implementation of the Forth-83 Standard written
   in C. Thus allowing it to be easily moved between different computers
   compared to traditional Forth implementations in assembly (most Forth
   implementations are done in assembly to be able to utilize the
   underlying architecture as optimal as possible).


time-1.4.tar.z
   `time' is used to time commands and report statistics about, among
   other things, the amount of user, system, and approximate real time
   used by a process.  Instructions for making time (no pun intended) are
   in the file "README".


tput-1.0.tar.z
   `tput' provides a portable way of allowing shell scripts to use
   special terminal capabilities.  Although its interface is similar to
   that of `terminfo'-based tput programs, this one uses `termcap'.
   Instructions for compiling tput are in the "README" file.


uucp-1.04.tar.z
   This version of UUCP was written by Ian Lance Taylor.  It will be the
   standard UUCP system for GNU.  It currently supports the `f', `g' (in
   all window and packet sizes), `G', `t' and `e' protocols, as well a
   Zmodem protocol and two new bidirectional protocols.  If you have a
   Berkeley sockets library, it can make TCP connections.  If you have
   TLI libraries, it can make TLI connections.  Other important notes
   about this version of UUCP, and instructions for building it, are in
   the file "README".


vh-1.4.tar.z
   This is a browser for the jargon files which are also in this
   directory.  It is not part of the GNU distribution proper.


wdiff-0.04.tar.z
   `wdiff' compares two files, finding which words have been deleted or
   added to the first for getting the second.
   
   We hope eventually to integrate `wdiff', as well as some ideas from a
   similar program called `spiff', into some future release of GNU
   `diff'.


xboard-2.1.pl9.tar.z
   XBoard is an X11/R4-based user interface for GNU Chess.  It uses the
   R4 Athena widgets and Xt Intrinsics to provide an interactive referee
   for managing a chess game between a user and a computer opponent or
   between two computers.  You can also use XBoard without a chess
   program to play through games in files or to play through games
   manually (force mode); in this case, moves aren't validated by XBoard.
   XBoard manages a digital chess clock for each player and resets the
   clocks if the proper number of moves are played within the time
   control period.  A game can be started with the initial chess
   position, with a series of moves from a game file or with a position
   from a position file.  The "match" shell script runs a series of games
   between two machines, alternating sides.  The man page xboard.man
   describes the features of XBoard.


xinfo-1.01.01.tar.z
   An X-based GNU info widget.
