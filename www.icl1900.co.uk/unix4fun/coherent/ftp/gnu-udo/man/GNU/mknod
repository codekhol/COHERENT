       This  manual  page  documents  the  GNU  version of mmkknnoodd.
       mmkknnoodd creates a FIFO, character  special  file,  or  block
       special  file  with  the  given pathname.  By default, the
       mode of created files is 0666 minus the bits  set  in  the
       umask.

       The  argument after the path specifies the type of file to
       make:
       p for a FIFO
       b for a block (buffered) special file
       c or u for a character (unbuffered) special file

       When making a block or character special file,  the  major
       and  minor  device  numbers  must  be given after the file
       type.
