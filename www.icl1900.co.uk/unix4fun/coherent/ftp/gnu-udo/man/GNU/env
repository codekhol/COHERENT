       This  manual  page  documents the GNU version of eennvv.  eennvv
       runs a command with an environment modified  as  specified
       by  the  command  line  arguments.   Arguments of the form
       `variable=value' set the environment variable _v_a_r_i_a_b_l_e  to
       value _v_a_l_u_e.  _v_a_l_u_e may be empty (`variable=').  Setting a
       variable to an empty value is different from unsetting it.

       The  first  remaining  argument  specifies  a  program  to
       invoke; it is searched for according to the  specification
       of the PATH environment variable.  Any arguments following
       that are passed as arguments to that program.

       If no command name is specified following the  environment
       specifications,  the  resulting  environment  is  printed.
       This is like specifying a command name of `printenv'.
