       This  manual  page  documents the GNU version of ssuumm.  ssuumm
       computes a 16-bit checksum for each  named  file,  or  the
       standard  input if none are given or when a file named `-'
       is given.  It prints the checksum for each file along with
       the number of blocks in the file (rounded up).  By default
       each corresponding file name is also printed if  at  least
       two arguments are specified.  With the _-_-_s_y_s_v option, cor-
       responding file name are printed when there  is  at  least
       one  file  argument.   By  default,  the  GNU ssuumm computes
       checksums using an algorithm that is compatible  with  the
       BSD ssuumm and prints file sizes in units of 1K blocks.

   OOPPTTIIOONNSS
       _-_r     Use  the  default (BSD compatible) algorithm.  This
              option is included for compatibility with the  Sys-
              tem V ssuumm.  Unless the _-_s option was also given, it
              has no effect.

       _-_s_, _-_-_s_y_s_v
              Compute checksums using an algorithm that  is  com-
              patible  with  the  one  the  System  V ssuumm uses by
              default and print file sizes in units  of  512-byte
              blocks instead of 1K.

       _-_-_h_e_l_p Print a usage message and exit with a non-zero sta-
              tus.

       _-_-_v_e_r_s_i_o_n
              Print version information on standard  output  then
              exit.
