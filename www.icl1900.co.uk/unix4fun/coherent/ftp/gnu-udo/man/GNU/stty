DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
       This manual page documents the GNU version  of  ssttttyy.   If
       given no arguments, ssttttyy prints the baud rate, line disci-
       pline number (on systems that support it), and  line  set-
       tings  that have been changed from the values set by `stty
       sane'.  Mode reading and setting are performed on the  tty
       line connected to the standard input.

       ssttttyy  accepts  the  following  non-option  arguments  that
       change aspects of the terminal line  operation.   A  `[-]'
       before  a  capability  means  that it can be turned off by
       preceding it with a `-'.  Some arguments are not available
       on all systems, since they use non-POSIX extensions.  Such
       arguments are marked below with `(np)'.

       Control settings:


       [-]parenb
              Generate parity bit in output and expect parity bit
              in input.

       [-]hupcl [-]hup
              Send  a  hangup signal when the last process closes
              the tty.

       [-]cstopb
              Use two stop bits per character (one with `-').
