       This manual page  documents  the  GNU  version  of  sspplliitt.
       sspplliitt  creates one or more output files (as many as neces-
       sary) containing consecutive sections of  the  _i_n_f_i_l_e,  or
       the  standard  input  if  none is given or the name `-' is
       given.  By default, sspplliitt puts 1000  lines  of  the  input
       file,  or  whatever  is left if it is less than that, into
       each output file.

       The output file names consist of a prefix  followed  by  a
       group  of letters, chosen so that concatenating the output
       files in sorted order by file name produces  the  original
       input file, in order.  The default output file name prefix
       is `x'.  If the _o_u_t_f_i_l_e_-_p_r_e_f_i_x argument is  given,  it  is
       used as the output file name prefix instead.

              Put  _l_i_n_e_s lines of the input file into each output
              file.

              Put _b_y_t_e_s bytes of the input file into each  output
              file.   _b_y_t_e_s is a nonzero integer, optionally fol-
              lowed by one of the following characters to specify
              a different unit.

              b      512-byte blocks.

              k      1-kilobyte blocks.

              m      1-megabyte blocks.

              Put into each output file as many complete lines of
              the input file as  is  possible  without  exceeding
              _b_y_t_e_s  bytes.   If a line that is longer than _b_y_t_e_s
              bytes occurs, put _b_y_t_e_s bytes of it into each  out-
              put  file  until  less than _b_y_t_e_s bytes of the line
              are left, then continue normally.   _b_y_t_e_s  has  the
              same format as for the _-_-_b_y_t_e_s option.

       _-_-_h_e_l_p Print a usage message and exit with a non-zero sta-
              tus.
