       This  manual page documents the GNU version of ddaattee.  ddaattee
       with no arguments prints the current time and date (in the
       format  of  the `%c' directive described below).  If given
       an argument that starts with a `+', it prints the  current
       time  and  date  in  a format controlled by that argument,
       which has the same format as the format string  passed  to
       the `strftime' function.  Except for directives that start
       with `%', characters in that string are printed unchanged.

       The directives are:

       %      a literal %

       n      a newline

       t      a horizontal tab

       Time fields:

       %H     hour (00..23)

       %I     hour (01..12)

       %k     hour ( 0..23)

       %l     hour ( 1..12)

       %M     minute (00..59)

       %p     locale's AM or PM

       %r     time, 12-hour (hh:mm:ss [AP]M)

       %S     second (00..61)

       %T     time, 24-hour (hh:mm:ss)

       %X     locale's time representation (%H:%M:%S)

       %Z     time  zone  (e.g., EDT), or nothing if no time zone
              is determinable

       Date fields:

       its, which have the following meaning:

       MM     month

       DD     day within month

       hh     hour
