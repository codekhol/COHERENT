       This  manual  page  documents the GNU version of ttrruuee (and
       probably every other version, as well).  ttrruuee does nothing
       except  return  an  exit status of 0, meaning ``success''.
       It can be used as a place holder in shell scripts where  a
       successful  command is needed, although the shell built-in
       command `:' (colon) does the same thing faster.

   OOPPTTIIOONNSS
       When GNU ttrruuee is invoked with exactly  one  argument,  the
       following options are recognized:

       _-_-_h_e_l_p Print  a  usage message on standard output and exit
              successfully.

       _-_-_v_e_r_s_i_o_n
              Print version information on standard  output  then
              exit successfully.
