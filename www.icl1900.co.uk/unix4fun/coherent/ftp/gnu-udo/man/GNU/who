       This  manual  page  documents  the GNU version of wwhhoo.  If
       given no non-option arguments, wwhhoo  prints  the  following
       information for each user currently logged on:

              login name
              terminal line
              login time
              remote hostname or X display

       If given one non-option argument, wwhhoo uses that instead of
       /etc/utmp as the name of the file containing the record of
       users  logged on.  /etc/wtmp is commonly given as an argu-
       ment to wwhhoo to look at who has previously logged on.

       If given two non-option arguments,  wwhhoo  prints  only  the
       entry  for  the user running it (determined from its stan-
       dard input), preceded by the hostname.  Traditionally, the
       two arguments given are `am i', as in `who am i'.

   OOPPTTIIOONNSS
       _-_m     Same as `who am i'.

       _-_q_, _-_-_c_o_u_n_t
              Print  only the login names and the number of users
              logged on.  Overrides all other options.

       _-_s     Ignored; for compatibility with other  versions  of
              wwhhoo.

       _-_i_, _-_u_, _-_-_i_d_l_e
              After the login time, print the number of hours and
              minutes that the user has been idle.  `.' means the
              user  was  active  in last minute.  `old' means the
              user was idle for more than 24 hours.

       _-_H_, _-_-_h_e_a_d_i_n_g
              Print a line of column headings.

       _-_w_, _-_T_, _-_-_m_e_s_g_, _-_-_m_e_s_s_a_g_e_, _-_-_w_r_i_t_a_b_l_e
              Like _-_s, plus after the login name print a  charac-
              ter indicating the user's message status:

              +      allowing wwrriittee messages

              -      disallowing wwrriittee messages
