       This  manual  page  describes  the  GNU  version of the ms
       macros, which is part of  the  groff  document  formatting
       system.  The groff ms macros are intended to be compatible
       with the 4.3 BSD Unix ms macros subject to  the  following
       limitations:

       +o      the  internals  of  groff ms are not similar to the
              internals of Unix ms and so documents  that  depend
              upon implementation details of Unix ms may well not
              work with groff ms;

       +o      there is no support for typewriter-like devices;

       +o      Berkeley localisms, in particular  the  TTMM  and  CCTT
              macros, are not implemented;

       +o      groff ms does not provide cut marks;

       +o      multiple  line spacing is not allowed (use a larger
              vertical spacing instead);

       +o      groff ms does not work in  compatibility  mode  (eg
              with the --CC option);

       +o      the  error-handling policy of groff ms is to detect
              and report errors, rather than silently  to  ignore
              them.

       The groff ms macros make use of many features of GNU troff
       and therefore cannot be used with any other troff.

       Bell Labs localisms are not implemented in either the  BSD
       ms macros or in the groff ms macros.

       Some  Unix ms documentation says that the CCWW and GGWW number
       registers can be used to control the column width and gut-
       ter width respectively.  This is not the case.  These num-
       ber registers are not used in groff ms.

       Macros that cause a reset set  the  indent.   Macros  that
       change  the  indent  do  not  increment  or  decrement the
       indent, but rather set  it  absolutely.   This  can  cause
       problems  for  documents  that define additional macros of
       their own.  The solution is to use not the iinn request  but
       instead the RRSS and RREE macros.

       The number register GGSS is set to 1 by the groff ms macros,

       but is not used by the Unix ms  macros.   It  is  intended
       that  documents  that  need  to determine whether they are
       being formatted with Unix ms or groff ms make use of  this
       number register.

       Footnotes  are implemented so that they can safely be used
       within keeps and displays.  Automatically  numbered  foot-
       notes  within  floating  keeps are not recommended.  It is
       safe to have another \\**** between a \\**** and the correspond-
       ing ..FFSS; it is required only that each ..FFSS occur after the
       corresponding \\**** and that the occurrences of ..FFSS  are  in
       the same order as the corresponding occurrences of \\****.

       The  strings  \\**{{  and  \\**}} can be used to begin and end a
       superscript.

       Some Unix V10 ms features are implemented.  The BB,  II  and
       BBII  macros  can have an optional third argument which will
       be printed in the current font before the first  argument.
       There  is  a  macro  CCWW like BB that changes to a constant-
       width font.

       The following strings can be redefined to adapt the  groff
       ms macros to languages other than English:

       The  font family is reset from the string FFAAMM; at initial-
       ization if this string is undefined it is set to the  cur-
       rent  font  family.  The point size, vertical spacing, and
       inter-paragraph spacing for footnotes are taken  from  the
       number  registers  FFPPSS,  FFVVSS,  and  FFPPDD; at initialization
       these are set to \\nn((PPSS--22, \\nn[[FFPPSS]]++22, and  \\nn((PPDD//22  respec-
       tively;  however,  if  any  of  these  registers  has been
       defined before initialization, it will not be set.

       Right-aligned displays are available with ..DDSS RR and ..RRDD.

       The following conventions are used for  names  of  macros,

       strings and number registers.  External names available to
       documents that use the groff ms macros contain only upper-
       case  letters  and  digits.   Internally  the  macros  are
       divided into modules.  Names used only within  one  module
       are  of the form _m_o_d_u_l_e**_n_a_m_e.  Names used outside the mod-
       ule in which they are defined are of the form _m_o_d_u_l_e@@_n_a_m_e.
       Names  associated with a particular environment are of the
       form _e_n_v_i_r_o_n_m_e_n_t::_n_a_m_e_; these are used only within the  ppaarr
       module,  and  _n_a_m_e  does  not  have a module prefix.  Con-
       structed names used to implement arrays are  of  the  form
       _a_r_r_a_y!!_i_n_d_e_x.  Thus the groff ms macros reserve the follow-
       ing names:

       +o      names containing **;

       +o      names containing @@;

       +o      names containing ::;

       +o      names containing only uppercase letters and digits.
