       rraannlliibb  generates  an index to the contents of an archive,
       and stores it in the archive.  The index lists each symbol
       defined  by  a  member of an archive that is a relocatable
       object file.

       You may use `nnmm --ss' or `nnmm ----pprriinntt--aarrmmaapp' to list this in-
       dex.

       An archive with such an index speeds up linking to the li-
       brary, and allows routines in the  library  to  call  each
       other without regard to their placement in the archive.

       The  GNU rraannlliibb program is another form of GNU aarr; running
       rraannlliibb is completely equivalent to executing `aarr --ss'.
