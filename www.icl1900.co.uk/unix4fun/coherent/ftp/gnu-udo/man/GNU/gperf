       _g_p_e_r_f  reads  a  set  of  ``keys''  from  _k_e_y_f_i_l_e  (or, by
       default, from the standard input) and attempts to  find  a
       non-minimal  perfect  hashing  function  that recognizes a
       member of the key set in constant, i.e., O(1),  time.   If
       such a function is found the program generates a pair of _C
       source code routines that perform the  hashing  and  table
       lookup.   All  generated  code is directed to the standard
       output.
