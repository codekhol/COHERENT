       This  manual  page  documents  the  GNU version of pprriinnttff.
       pprriinnttff prints the _f_o_r_m_a_t string, interpreting  `%'  direc-
       tives  and  `\'  escapes in the same way as the C `printf'
       function.  The _f_o_r_m_a_t argument is re-used as many times as
       necessary to convert all of the given arguments.

       pprriinnttff interprets `\0ooo' as a an octal number (`ooo' is 0
       to 3 digits) specifying a character to print, and  `\xhhh'
       as  a hexadecimal number (`hhh' is 1 to 3 digits) specify-
       ing a character to print.  It has  an  additional  escape,
       `\c',  which  causes  pprriinnttff to produce no further output,
       and an additional directive, `%b', which prints its  argu-
       ment  string with `\' escapes interpreted the way they are
       in the _f_o_r_m_a_t string.
