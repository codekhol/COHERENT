       This  manual  page  documents the GNU version of tteeee.  The
       tteeee command copies the standard input to the standard out-
       put and any files given as arguments.

       If  a  file being written to does not already exist, it is
       created.  If a file being written to already  exists,  the
       data  it previously contained is overwritten unless the _-_a
       option is used.
