       This  manual  page  documents  the  GNU  version of cckkssuumm.
       cckkssuumm computes a cyclic redundancy check  (CRC)  for  each
       named  file,  or  the  standard input if none are given or
       when a file named `-' is given.  It  prints  the  CRC  for
       each  file along with the number of bytes in the file, and
       the file name unless no arguments were given.

       cckkssuumm is typically used to make sure that files have  been
       transferred by unreliable means (such as netnews) have not
       been corrupted, by comparing  the  cckkssuumm  output  for  the
       received  files  with  the  cckkssuumm  output for the original
       files.  The CRC algorithm  is  specified  by  the  POSIX.2
       standard.   It  is not compatible with the BSD or System V
       ssuumm programs; it is more robust.

       _-_-_h_e_l_p Print a usage message and exit with a non-zero sta-
              tus.

       _-_-_v_e_r_s_i_o_n
              Print  version  information on standard output then
              exit.
