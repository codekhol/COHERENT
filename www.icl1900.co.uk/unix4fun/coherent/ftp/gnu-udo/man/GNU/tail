       This  manual page documents the GNU version of ttaaiill.  ttaaiill
       prints the last part (10 lines by default) of  each  given
       file;  it  reads from standard input if no files are given
       or when a filename of `-' is encountered.   If  more  than
       one  file  is  given, it prints a header consisting of the
       file's name enclosed in `==>' and `<==' before the  output
       for each file.

       The  GNU  ttaaiill  can  output any amount of data, unlike the
       Unix version, which uses a fixed size buffer.  It  has  no
       _-_r  option (print in reverse).  Reversing a file is really
       a different job from printing the end of a file;  the  BSD
       ttaaiill  can  only reverse files that are at most as large as
       its buffer, which is typically 32k.  A reliable  and  more
       versatile way to reverse files is the GNU ttaacc command.

       ttaaiill  accepts  two  option  formats: the new one, in which
       numbers are arguments to the option letters, and  the  old
       one, in which a `+' or `-' and optional number precede any
       option letters.

       If a number (`N') starts with a `+', ttaaiill begins  printing
       with  the Nth item from the start of each file, instead of
       from the end.

       _-_c _N_, _-_-_b_y_t_e_s _N
              Tail by N bytes.  N is a nonzero  integer,  option-
              ally followed by one of the following characters to
              specify a different unit.

              b      512-byte blocks.

              k      1-kilobyte blocks.

              m      1-megabyte blocks.

       _-_f_, _-_-_f_o_l_l_o_w
              Loop forever trying to read more characters at  the
              end of the file, on the assumption that the file is
              growing.  Ignored if reading from a pipe.  If  more
              than  one file is given, ttaaiill prints a header when-
              ever it gets  output  from  a  different  file,  to

TAIL(1L)                                                 TAIL(1L)


              indicate which file that output is from.

       _-_l_, _-_n _N_, _-_-_l_i_n_e_s _N
              Tail  by  N lines.  _-_l is only recognized using the
              old option format.

       _-_q_, _-_-_q_u_i_e_t_, _-_-_s_i_l_e_n_t
              Never print filename headers.

       _-_v_, _-_-_v_e_r_b_o_s_e
              Always print filename headers.

       _-_-_h_e_l_p Print a usage message and exit with a non-zero sta-
              tus.

       _-_-_v_e_r_s_i_o_n
              Print  version  information on standard output then
              exit.
