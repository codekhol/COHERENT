       The  _g_z_e_x_e  utility  allows you to compress executables in
       place and have them automatically uncompress  and  execute
       when  you  run  them  (at  a penalty in performance).  For
       example if you execute ``gzexe /bin/cat'' it  will  create
       the following two files:
           -r-xr-xr-x  1 root  bin   9644 Feb 11 11:16 /bin/cat
           -r-xr-xr-x  1 bin   bin  24576 Nov 23 13:21 /bin/cat~
       /bin/cat~  is  the original file and /bin/cat is the self-
       uncompressing executable file.  You can  remove  /bin/cat~
       once you are sure that /bin/cat works properly.

       This  utility  is  most  useful on systems with very small
       disks.

       The compressed executable is a shell script. This may cre-
       ate some security holes.  In  particular,  the  compressed
       executable relies on the PATH environment variable to find
       _g_z_i_p and some other utilities _(_t_a_i_l_, _c_h_m_o_d_, _l_n_, _s_l_e_e_p_)_.

BBUUGGSS
       _g_z_e_x_e attempts to retain the original file  attributes  on
       the  compressed  executable,  but you may have to fix them
       manually in some cases, using _c_h_m_o_d or _c_h_o_w_n_.
