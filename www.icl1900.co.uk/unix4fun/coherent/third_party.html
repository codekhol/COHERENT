<p><b><font size="5">Introduction:</font></b></p>
In 1994 there were like 150 third party applications available
for COHERENT 4.2. Most were commercial, copyrighted products and
can't be made available, but I can write a bit about the history,
as far as I was involved.
<p>
MWC had copies of all this products available, tech support
used them to help customers to install and configure the stuff.
In development we used the applications to improve the binary
compatibility of COHERENT and as regression tests, if improved
versions of the operating system would break anything.
<p>
At this time I was reading Intel's iBCS2 manual forth and back
to improve kernel calls and library functions for compatibility,
so that stuff running on Interactive UNIX would work the same
on COHERENT.
<br>
<br>
<br>

<a name="gnu"></a>
<p><b><font size="5">GNU tools:</font></b></p>
In 1993 there was an increasing demand for running GNU software on
COHERENT. Besides the GNU compilers users mostly asked for emacs,
perl, bash, so I just got many of the GNU tools from prep.ai.mit.edu
available at this time.
Building was pretty much straightforward with the newly ported
and complete GNU development toolchain.
<p>
Right from the beginning I decided to build all the GNUish stuff
on an own filesystem, to avoid any conflicts with other existing
software. Fortunately GNU configure already supported this with
an option ./configure --prefix=/some/directory.
<p>
Interestingly you'll find similar mechanisms on modern systems.
Several Linux systems provide a command <b>alternatives</b>, that
allows to install and switch between software from different
vendors with same functionality. Also the <b>brew</b> package
management for OSX builds applications in the Cellar and
sets symbolic links to the builds in /usr/local.
<p>
On COHERENT we had no symbolic links, so I implemented this
by using different paths, which can be setup and switched as needed.
On the 4.2 systems /etc/profile has shell functions <b>MWC</b> and
<b>GNU</b> that are used to switch environments.
<br>
<br>

<a name="xtree"></a>
<p><b><font size="5">Xtree:</font></b></p>
You might know that I wrote a visual shell for UNIX systems
named <b>vsh</b>, if not you can mess with it under COHERENT 4.2.
My colleagues at MWC liked the program and so it was included with
the 4.2 distributions. Here also a screenshot how it looks like:

<p>
You have no idea how many request I got to make it working more
like the famous <b>xtree</b> DOS program ;-) Sorry folks, I was not
interested in programming a <b>xtree</b> clone, I wanted to implement my own
ideas about how a visual shell for UNIX systems should work.
Also <b>xtree</b> was available for UNIX systems, so no point in cloning
it.
<p>
If you bought a COHERENT 4.2 OS in 1994 from MWC you got a free
copy of <b>xtree</b> in a bundle. At MWC we also got it, of course I
was curious about it and installed it on my systems to have a look.
I still have my copy, so I installed it again on a COHERENT VM,
here is a screenshot how it looks like:

<p>
Of course <b>xtree</b> was a copyrighted commercial third party product,
so I can't make it available here. However, the product was continued
under the new name <b>UnixTree</b> as Open Source, you can grab it
<a href="http://www.unixtree.org">here</a>.

<a name="motif"></a>
<p><b><font size="5">OSF Motif:</font></b></p>
In 1993 Sun Microsystems and AT&T announced that they would drop Open Look and
move to OSF Motif. What followed was a rush to get Motif implemented on
all the X11 workstations available at that time. I was contacted by
Sequoia International, Inc., if I could help with a good working GNU
development toolchain for COHERENT. Of course I could, I send them a tape
with /u1/gnu, and eventually OSF Motif was
<a href="http://www.geomview.org/docs/sgarchive/msg01649.shtml">announced</a>.
In return they send me a copy of their Motif implementation for COHERENT,
which I still have. In 2017 I installed it again on a Virtualbox VM
running COHERENT 4.2 + RTR/MWC X11R5, here a screenshot how it looks like:
<p>

<p>
The screenshot shows one of the example programs included in Motif
distributions, animated GUI widgets was one of the interesting new
features to play with. The look and feel of the Motif GUI was copied
by many others and we basically still use it on nowadays modern systems.
Of course this is a commercial product, so I cannot make it available,
but nowadays OSF Motif is Open Source and it could be build from the
released sources.
