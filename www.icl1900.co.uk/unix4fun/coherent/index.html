<p><b><font size="5">Introduction:</font></b></p>
In 1990 Mark Williams Company released COHERENT 3.0, a clone of
the UNIX V7 operating system for Intel 286 based systems.
I already had a real nice PC with Intel 386 CPU, I passed on the PC XT
and PC AT because of the technically bad design of these systems.
At this time I was working for Nixdorf Computer and had access to all and
any UNIX systems they had there in the labs. Besides the large RISC mainframes
the smaller Nixdorf UNIX systems were based on 68020 and 386 CPU's, so I knew
that a 386 machine would do what I wanted.
<p>
I got COHERENT 3.0, installed it on my private 386 box and got
hooked. Sure, the system was limited by the MMU of the 286 CPU, processes
have a 64KB code and a 64KB data segment, same as UNIX V7 on the
PDP-11, but the system was very complete and fun to use. It came
with a HDB uucp and soon I had it online with an analog modem, exchanging
email and Usenet news via uucp. This also enabled me to get access
to sources for applications and tools written for UNIX systems,
that were shared over the uucp network at this time. I collaborated
with many others using Minix and COHERENT, to make such applications
available for theses small systems. See the old COHERENT archives,
there you'll find most of the stuff we did and shared with others.
<p>
In 1992 COHERENT 4.0 for the 386/486 was released, the limitations
of the 286 gone, and the whole system looked pretty much like the
UNIX System V.3 boxes I was using for work. This is meant API wise,
UNIX System V.3 has more features than COHERENT, but it is possible
to get most software written for UNIX working on COHERENT.
Also the system is iBCS2 compatible, so it runs the same shrinkwrap
applications like the other 386 UNIX systems from SCO, Interactive
and so on. The old HDB uucp was replaced with Taylor uucp from
Ian Lance Taylor, which you'll still find on almost any modern UNIX systems
nowadays.
<p>
In 1993 I was asked if I would like to work for Mark Williams.
After a visit at the office in Northbrook, Illinois we came to an
agreement and I started to work for MWC until 1995, when the
company was closed.
<p>
In 1994 Mark Williams released COHERENT 4.2, with STREAMS, POSIX.1
and POSIX.2 compatibility and other features, that made the system
pretty much look like UNIX System V.4. Again, meant API wise, UNIX
System V.4 has many more features than COHERENT.
<p>
These pages are dedicated to my former colleagues and friends
from Mark Williams Company. It is a honor to have known and worked
with you all. In January 2015, Robert "Bob" Swartz (founder and president
of MWC) agreed to open posting of COHERENT command and system sources under

Thank you very much for this Bob, now it is possible to build systems that
can be shared with others, and archive all this work done over decades in
an accessible manner.
<p>
A while ago I said (post 9 in the thread)
<a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/comp.os.coherent/TLMouSQKBfc">
this</a>. Now it is possible, so I'm at work.

<p><b><font size="5">Oracle Virtualbox:</font></b></p>
<p>
Virtualbox is a powerful Open Source x86 and Intel64/AMD64 virtualization 
product.
In 2016 Oracle <a href="https://www.virtualbox.org/">Virtualbox</a>
5.0.14 was released and the VM now is able to run COHERENT 4.2 systems,
wasn't working with releases 
<a href="https://www.virtualbox.org/ticket/12579">before</a>.
Thanks to the Virtualbox team for making it working, much appreciated.
<p>
COHERENT releases before 4.2 are not working, emulation of floppy disk
and harddisk controllers is not exact enough. The older versions
can be used on other virtualizations like QEMU and PCem.
<p>
<hr>
<p>
Before we get at work, you don't have to read and work through this.
You can just download Virtualbox and a ready to use VM, I provide here
under Downloads.
Good enough if you just want to use a working COHERENT system.
However, this is a very complex VM
and I'll try to explain some of the details, how to use it for
running COHERENT. So sometime you should get back and read a bit
of the following, to become familiar with the VM configuration.
<p>
That said, let's configure a VM now. You do that
by clicking on New in the Virtualbox Manager and then follow the dialog.
The following screenshots and explanations will show the VM configuration
I'm using successfully on host systems with OSX and Windows 7, should also
work with Solaris or Linux hosts.
<p>
<img src="settings-1.png" style="float:left; margin:10px;">
For the VM Version don't use a 64bit one, COHERENT 4.x is a
32bit OS.
<br style="clear: both;">
</p>
<p>
<img src="settings-2.png" style="float:left; margin:10px;">
It is not possible to install Virtualbox tools on COHERENT, so we disable
the features here, requiring the guest OS running the tools.
<br style="clear: both;">
</p>
<p>
<img src="settings-3.png" style="float:left; margin:10px;">
COHERENT 4.x supports 16MB memory, no point in assigning more to the VM.
<br>
For the motherboard chipset use PIIX3, that already is for Pentium II
systems that came years after 1995. It will also run with PIIX4 and later
ICH chipsets, not suggested to use these.
<br>
For the pointing device use PS/2 Mouse, way back I wrote a device driver for
that, we'll get at this later.
<br>
Uncheck I/O APIC and EFI, COHERENT doesn't support it, came years after
1995.
<br style="clear: both;">
</p>
<p>
<img src="settings-4.png" style="float:left; margin:10px;">
Use 1 CPU for COHERENT. Nigel modified kernel and drivers to use SMP
locks instead of spin locks, the base for SMP is there, but we never
got it implemented fully before MWC closed.
<br>
Uncheck PAE/NX extensions, COHERENT won't use them.
<br style="clear: both;">
</p>
<p>
<img src="settings-5.png" style="float:left; margin:10px;">
Don't use Virtualization features, COHERENT is not aware about
running under control of a VM hypervisor, there was none in 1995.
<br style="clear: both;">
</p>
<p>
<img src="settings-6.png" style="float:left; margin:10px;">
The VGA video cards of 90th PC's had 64-128KB video memory, some more
and some also used banked memory. Later VESA cards had 512KB-2MB
video memory. Set Video Memory to lowest possible setting, which
is 1MB. The OS can't use the video framebuffer for code or data
of course, higher settings just reduce the memory the system can
use for running programs.
<br>
Uncheck Acceleration, it is not used for now.
<br style="clear: both;">
</p>
<p>
<img src="settings-7.png" style="float:left; margin:10px;">
Add an IDE controller and a Floppy Controller to the system. For the
IDE controller also use the PIIX3 chipset, later chipsets might
not work reliable with the COHERENT at device driver.
<br>
You can enable the Host I/O cache, but COHERENT uses it's own
buffer cache for the filesystem. This also might slow down your host
system, see the Virtualbox manual for details.
<br style="clear: both;">
</p>
<p>
<img src="settings-8.png" style="float:left; margin:10px;">
Add a Harddisk image to the IDE disk controller. Use a 500MB Harddisk,
it is possible to use larger ones, if one knows what one is doing.
With 500MB drives you won't run into problems, so use this if you're
not familiar with the workarounds. Also make sure the drive is the
Primary Master.
<br>
I have used a dynamically allocated storage device here in this example.
It is better to use fixed storage devices. One won't save much with
the dynamic ones, because mkfs already scribbles all over the plate, and
so forces the VM to expand it anyway.
<br>
Exported VM's always have dynamically allocated storage devices to save
space. Before you start the VM clone the disk image to a fixed
one with <b>VBoxManage clonehd infile outfile --variant Fixed</b> and attach
this image to the IDE controller. Also see the Virtualbox manual for
details.
<p>
<br style="clear: both;">
</p>
<p>
<img src="settings-9.png" style="float:left; margin:10px;">
We wrote Soundblaster device drivers for COHERENT way back then,
so you can enable Audio and set the Audio Controller to SoundBlaster 16.
I'll get at this later.
<br style="clear: both;">
</p>
<p>
<img src="settings-10.png" style="float:left; margin:10px;">
COHERENT 4.x has no networking implemented, disable the Network
Adapters.
<br style="clear: both;">
</p>
<p>
<img src="settings-11.png" style="float:left; margin:10px;">
Enable the serial ports, so that you can telnet into the VM.
This setting shows the odd configuration needed for a Windows
host for Virtualbox releases before 5.0.16, the TCP/IP socket was not working.
If you use several VM's with serial ports better name the
host pipe like \\.\pipe\coh1-com1 etc. and use different
names for the COM1 port for every VM.
<br>
With Virtualbox 5.0.16 this is fixed and TCP/IP sockets are working now.
Also the number of ports was increased to 4. Before you use more than 2
ports read <b>man asy</b>, because of the shared interrupts some ports
need to be configured for polling.
<br style="clear: both;">
</p>
<p>
<img src="settings-12.png" style="float:left; margin:10px;">
On UNIX hosts use a TCP/IP socket as shown in this setting. For the port
number you might want to avoid 4000-4019, I use these for my virtual
8080/Z80 machines and of course I want to connect all these virtual
systems via serial ports.
<br>
Please note that Virtualbox implements raw sockets, no telnet negotiation
done. For using a telnet client escape to the telnet prompt and use
the command <b>mode character</b>, else it does local editing and local echo.
<br style="clear: both;">
</p>
<p>
<img src="settings-13.png" style="float:left; margin:10px;">
COHERENT doesn't support USB devices, disable it.
<br style="clear: both;">
</p>
<p>
<img src="settings-14.png" style="float:left; margin:10px;">
Shared Folders are not possible without running Virtualbox tools
on the guest system, so none here.
<br style="clear: both;">

<p><b><font size="5">Installing COHERENT 4.2 on Virtualbox:</font></b></p>
<p>
So now we have configured a proper VM and we are going to install
COHERENT on it. You need to download the disk images from here under
<a href="ftp/index.html">Downloads</a> or elsewhere. I would suggest you use
the Y2K fixed disk1, because the 1970 date will cause problems of all
kind, special if you want to build applications from sources with make.
<p>
Just switch the VM on, it will complain that no bootable media was found.
Attach disk1 to the floppy controller, reset the VM and off you go.
The installation procedure is documented in great detail in the COHERENT
release notes and COHERENT FAQ's, so I won't write more about it. Also I
made a video showing the complete installation:
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v22LcFoRS8E">Let's install COHERENT</a>
<p>
COHERENT is not copy-protected, but asks about a serial number early
in the installation. You can use your own if you still have it, or use
<b>47610000</b>, this one was used internally at MWC and you're free to
use it now.
<p>
Do not use the loadable keyboard drivers, use the not loadable
US keyboard driver. The loadable drivers use keyboard scancode set 3,
which is not implemented correctly in Virtualbox. The kernel will stop
with a diagnose code displayed in the upper right corner of the screen,
if the keyboard is not working.
<p>
At this point you should have a working COHERENT base system.
The first thing you want to do now is enabling the serial ports,
so that you are able to telnet into the VM. Edit /etc/ttys
and enable the serial line com1l by changing the 0 to 1,
so that the file looks like this:
<pre>
	1lPcom1l
	0lPcom2l
	0lPcom3l
	0lPcom4l
	....
</pre>
The baud rate doesn't really matter, because TCP/IP sockets or host
pipes have none, see <b>man ttys</b> for the details.
Also edit /etc/ttytype and append a line
for com1l:
<pre>
	....
	ansipc  color6
	ansipc  color7
	xterm   com1l
</pre>
See <b>man ttytype</b> for the details, terminal type xterm is pretty much
the best option for the terminal.
<p>
Then use <b>kill quit 1</b> so that the init process
re-reads /etc/ttys and starts the getty process for the serial port.
On UNIX hosts you can now <b>telnet localhost 4020</b> or whatever port
you configured for COM1. As mentioned above, Virtualbox has raw sockets
only, so telnet won't negotiate a useful setting and the default is no
good. So escape to the telnet prompt with CNTL-], type <b>mode character</b>
followed by a few CR until you get the login prompt.
<p>
If you are using a Windows host you very likely already have, or now want,
<a href="http://www.putty.org/">PuTTY</a>. For connecting to this
odd host pipes use this setting:
<br>
<br>
<img src="putty-1.png">
<br>
<br>
And there you go.
<br>
<br>
<img src="putty-2.png">
<br>
<br>
This screenshot was done with installation of the original disk1,
the system uses 1970 date, because 1916 is implausible. And
all files on the filesystems have timestamps from the future,
causing problems. The exported VM's are installed with the Y2K fixed
disk, so that it uses the correct date.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<a name="conf_coh"></a>
<p><b><font size="5">Configuring COHERENT 4.2:</font></b></p>
<p>
After installation I have configured the COHERENT system a bit more
to my liking. This all is done on the exported VM's already, if you
setup a system your self, you might like some of this configuration
too.
<p>
The 4.2.x releases come with the Bourne shell <b>/bin/sh</b> linked
to the C Shell <b>/bin/csh</b>. This is not good, because configure
scripts coming from an environment where the C shell is preferred
will fail, because of the different syntax. Remove <b>/bin/csh</b>,
it is not needed, but it will get in your way sometime.
<p>
Edit /etc/.kshrc and comment unset ENV, this causes problems
with X11, because the shell looses the environment and then
several things are not working correct. Here the configuration
I am using, I also modified the shell prompt to a more
informative one.
<br>
<pre>
	# /etc/.kshrc
	# Wed Oct 27 05:14:15 1993 CST

	# Use set -o emacs for emacs history mode.
	# Use set -o vi for vi history mode.
	set -o vi
	#echo "ksh: vi command history mode.  Edit /etc/.kshrc to change this."

	# Set shell prompt to give login device, user name, and current directory.
	#PS1=`tty | sed 's/^.....//'`" $USER \$PWD: "
	PS1="\$USER@\$SITE:\$PWD> "

	# Allow ^C to send SIGINT even when editing command line.
	bind '^C=abort'

	# Some subshells (e.g. without tty) may be unable to use this file.
	#unset ENV
</pre>
<p>
Append the following to /etc/profile, this provides
a good working environment for things we'll use later:
<br>
<pre>
	# customization for X11, GNU compilers, etc.
	set -- $(tty) $(uname -n)
	export TTY=${1#/dev/}
	export SITE=$2

	MWC () {
        	export PATH=:/bin:/usr/bin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/X11/bin
	}

	GNU () {
        	export PATH=:/u1/gnu/bin:/bin:/usr/bin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/X11/bin
	}

	MWC
</pre>
<p>
After this ~/.profile for any other user you create on your system
only needs the following single line, because everything else is
set in the system wide environment.
<br>
<pre>
	MAIL=/usr/spool/mail/&lt;login&gt;
</pre>
<p>
By default COHERENT comes configured with / as the home directory
for the root user. I never liked that because many programs create
.xxxrc  like files and directories in the users home directory,
but I want my / nice and clean. To change this <b>mkdir /home/root</b>,
edit /etc/shadow and /etc/passwd and change / to /home/root. Then
move the .xxxrc files from / to /home/root, logout and login again, done.
<p>
In the home directory of user root you'll have .exrc with settings that
are fine for the PC color console, showing some features that can be used
to setup vi. However, if you try to run vi from a telnet
session it will complain a lot about this settings. I just renamed
the file to .exrc.not, so that it isn't used.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<a name="inst_ddk"></a>
<p><b><font size="5">Installing Device Driver Kit 4.2:</font></b></p>
<p>
To install the DDK use this command as user root:
<br>
<pre>
	install Drv_420 /dev/fva0 1
</pre>
After the files got installed on the COHERENT system a post script
/conf/Drv_420.post will be executed, it will build a kernel /ddk_420.
On some installations I did it just worked, on some it aborted because
timestamps are not correct, which will cause problems with build processes
dependent on correct timestamps. If that happens do:
<br>
<pre>
	cd /etc/conf
	find . -name "*.c" -exec touch {} \;
	find . -name "*.s" -exec touch {} \;
</pre>
Now all sources have current timestamps and are newer than the
object files from the 90th. Then run /conf/Drv_420.post and the
test kernel will be build.
<p>
Check the kernels under /, the DDK build one (ddk_420) and the one
from the COHERENT installation (coherent) should be identical, both
versions do match.
<p>
With the DDK installed you now are able to install the PS/2 mouse driver,
you can download from here. The archive includes a README with all
informations needed, to build a kernel including the driver.
Read the DDK manual too, if you build new kernels never overwrite your
working kernel, always create a kernel /coh.test or similar, and
test if the system boots and works with it. After that you can link autoboot
to your own kernel, so that it is used by default for booting COHERENT.
<p>
If you boot COHERENT you might have noticed that it detects a Cyrix CPU,
which is not correct. This can be modified with kernel tuning, as user
root do:
<pre>
	/etc/conf/bin/idtune CYRIX_CPU_SPEC 0xFFFF
</pre>
On a system with kernel source kit do:
<pre>
	cd /u1/src/kernel-4210/build/i386
	bld fva -o /coh.4210
</pre>
Or on a base system:
<pre>
	/etc/conf/bin/idmkcoh -o /coh.4210
</pre>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<a name="inst_x11"></a>
<p><b><font size="5">Installing MWC/RTR X11 on COHERENT 4.2:</font></b></p>
<p>
If you read the X11R5 manual provided by MWC it says that a serial
mouse is required for running X. This is not correct, the XFree 1.2
server also does support a PS/2 mouse. At the time the manual was
written we had no driver for these devices, so they couldn't be used.
<p>
In 1994 I wrote a PS/2 mouse driver and it works with this release
of X11R5. This is why you installed the DDK and the driver before.
Frankly, when I was trying this the first time on Virtualbox I was
prepared, that this driver software would require some changes to
work with a VM, more than 20 years after I wrote it. Much to my
surprise and my delight this is not the case.
<p>
Now install X11R5 with this command as user root:
<pre>
	install CohX /dev/fva0 2
</pre>
The dialog is straightforward, but at some time you are asked
to select one of the serial mice. It doesn't matter what you
select here, because we'll change the configuration file anyway.
After that the installation procedure will test the mouse, which
of course will not work. Just ignore and answer the question if
your mouse is working with y and finish the installation.
<p>
Then edit /usr/X11/lib/Xconfig and make it look like this:
<pre>
	RGBPath "/usr/X11/lib/rgb/"
	Fontpath        "/usr/X11/lib/fonts/misc/,/usr/X11/lib/fonts/75dpi/"

	#Mouse configuration
	#microsoft "/dev/mouse"		<- whatever serial mouse was configured
	#emulate3buttons		   comment it out
	#BaudRate 1200
	#SampleRate 150
	PS/2 "/dev/mouse"		<- and add the PS/2 mouse

	#Monochrome server
	vga2
	Modes "800x600" "640x480"	<- 800x600 first
	Clocks 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16
	Virtual 800 600
	Viewport 0 0

	#Color server
	vga256
	Modes "640x480" "800x600"
	Clocks 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16
	Virtual 800 600
	Viewport 0 0
</pre>
Now login with a non privileged user and type <b>startx</b>. If everything
was done correctly you'll see something like this:
<br>
<br>
<img src="X11R5.png">
<br>
<br>
X11R5 with XFree 1.2 and the good old TWM window manager, that is
how it looked like in 1993. Virtualbox provides a generic VGA
card, so the color X server doesn't work. With this release of XFree
only the monochrome X server with a maximal resolution 800x600 can
be used with Virtualbox.
<br>
Soon we ported ol(v)wm and fvwm too, these look and handle somewhat
more like a modern window manager. The source ports can be found in
the old COHERENT archives, linked below. I even found some archived
chat about the stuff we did in 1993
<a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/comp.os.coherent/vhpoy7p7Aqc">here</a>.
<p>
Congratulations, you now have a COHERENT system as we used it in
the 90th. Read through the excellent MWC documentation for the system,
grab some software from the old COHERENT archives and try it out.
<p>
Thanks for reading this far and if you have problems to get it working
feel free to drop me a line, or better post your problem to the Usenet
newsgroup.
