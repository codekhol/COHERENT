After my adventures with the Bellcore MGR Window System I started to use
X11R5 under COHERENT in 1993. The first implementation was done by
Answer Software & Consulting (ASC) for the COHERENT 4.0 release, later
updated for COHERENT 4.2.
The second implementation was done by Ready-to-Run Software Inc. (RTR) for
MWC and distributed by MWC for the COHERENT 4.2 release.
<p>
The ASC X11R5 distribution came on six 3.5" floppy disks and was pretty
complete. It also came with some goodies like the Open Look window manager,
MIT's TWM wasn't something one really would like to use, even not way back
then. With this distribution it was possible to build and use the free
available X11R5 software right away.
<p>
The RTR/MWC distribution came on two 3.5" floppy disks, MWC should
receive an award for building the smallest X11R5 distribution ever ;-)
Besides the XFree 1.2 color and monochrome X servers most MIT clients
were included, but not much more. For example the distribution only came
with a few most essential fonts to keep it this small. Many applications
just won't run with that, so I started to work on additional stuff, to
build a usable GUI from this minimal base system.
<p>
Also the first revision had a number of bugs we fixed after
the release. You'll still find these bugfixes as Xkit.tgz in the old
COHERENT archives. Don't try to apply it to a system, the X11R5
distribution disks we have are revision 2 including these bugfixes.
<p>
The following describes which modifications I made to get an usable
GUI for me, if you download a VM or disk images from here, all this
changes are included already.

The first problem you'll likely run into is, that editors won't
work in the X11 terminal emulations. This is because of wrong
initial window size 80x25 instead of 80x24 in /usr/X11/lib/xinit/xinitrc
as well as in /usr/X11/lib/twm/system.twmrc.
Also COHERENT has no signal SIGWINCH implementation, so there is no
way to inform applications running on terminal emulations about
window size changes. For resizing the terminal emulations
exit running applications, then resize the window and adjust
the environment with: <b>eval `resize`</b>. After that text
applications can be started again and will work with the new
window size.
<p>
The terminal emulations were installed without setuid root permissions,
without utmp entries cannot be written, and the <b>who</b> command will
not show all terminal sessions. This can be corrected:
<pre>
	chmod 6755 /usr/X11/bin/xterm
	chmod 6755 /usr/X11/bin/rvt
</pre>
<p>
Next problem are all the missing fonts, I just got them from
a X11R5 CDROM and build tar archives with installation scripts
which you'll find
<a href="http://www.autometer.de/unix4fun/coherent/ftp/distrib/X11R5/">here</a>.
<p>
With these changes so far one now can run any X11R5 applications on the
system, but building applications from sources still yields another
problem. The distribution comes with source for the application
<b>xwave</b> in /usr/X11/src. After unarchiving the source creating the
Makefile from Imakefile with <b>xmkmf</b> results in lots of errors.
The X11R5 distribution was build to use /lib/cpp as preprocessor, which
is the MWC one of course. MWC's cpp cannot handle some of the macros
used in the <b>xmkmf</b> configuration files, this requires GNU cpp.
The OS distribution included a build GNU cpp as /usr/local/bin/cpp
and the X11R5 build should have used that of course. So unfortunately we have to
fix the problem by substituting MWC cpp with GNU cpp. I have not
removed the MWC cpp, I renamed it and linked the GNU cpp to /lib/cpp,
so still both versions are available if needed:
<pre>
-r-x--x--x  2 root       root         91880 Sat May 21  1994 /lib/cpp
-r-x--x--x  2 root       root         91880 Sat May 21  1994 /lib/cpp.gnu
-r-x--x--x  1 bin        bin          10688 Fri Sep 30  1994 /lib/cpp.r14
</pre>
And now we are able to build X11R5 applications from the sources with:
<pre>
	xmkmf
	make
</pre>
