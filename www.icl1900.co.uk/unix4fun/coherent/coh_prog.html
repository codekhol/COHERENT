<p><b><font size="5">Introduction:</font></b></p>
<br>
<br>
COHERENT comes with a good K&R C compiler, that also supports some ANSI
standard features. What it does not support are ANSI prototypes, which
was usual for UNIX C compilers in the early 90th. This wasn't really
a problem, because one always can formulate:
<p>
<pre>
	#ifndef __STDC__
	  int main(argc, argv)
	  int argc;
	  char **argv;
	#else
	  int main(int argc, char **argv)
	#endif
</pre>
<p>
With this sources would compile with K&R as well as with ANSI C compilers,
of course it often wasn't done, and modifying large C projects can become
tedious.
<p>
Fortunatly this process can be easily automated, Wietse Venema wrote an
unprotoize filter for this in 1993. With a traditional AT&amp;T UNIX compiler
the program can be embedded between the cpp and the syntax parser phase of the
compiler. With the MWC compilers this is not possible, in the 3.x
compilers cpp and the syntax parser are not separate programs connected
with pipes, and for the 4.x releases a monolithic compiler was distributed,
not using pipes at all.
<p>
In 1994 I build a package 'ansicc' from unproto, GNU cpp and a shell script
driver, feeding MWC cc with the filtered source. GNU cpp was needed
because unproto generated directives not understood by MWC cpp.
This package still is available in old archives, but should not be
used anymore.
<p>
In 2020 I improved unproto 1.6 from 1993 together with Nils M. Holm,
so that it works on any COHERENT system with either MWC cpp or GNU cpp.
This improved version 1.7 is maintained at
<a href="https://github.com/udo-munk/unproto">GitHub</a>, because it is useful
for any system with only a traditional K&R compiler available.
<p>
So instead of invoking cc one uses acc to compile C89 ANSI C source with
the MWC compiler.
<br>
<br>
<br>

<a name="gnu"></a>
<p><b><font size="5">GNU compilers:</font></b></p>
In 1992 the GNU C compilers already supported the i386 target and MWC began
with porting the compiler to COHERENT 4.0. First a port of a 1.x
release was necessary, these can be build with the K&R
compilers available on UNIX systems. Releases 2.x and later of the
GNU compilers only can be build with it self, support for building
with native UNIX development tools was removed.
<p>
Then the ported 1.4 GNU C compiler was used to build the 2.3 C and C++
GNU compilers for COHERENT, the current available release at this time.
Also ports of the GNU assembler and linker became necessary for support
of source code debugging, the MWC development tools at this time removed
the .stabs debugging records from COFF object files.
<p>
In 1993 I used MWC's port of GNU C 2.3 to build the GNU 2.5 stable
C, C++ and Objective C compilers, binary tools, C++ library and source
code debugger for COHERENT 4.2. These alternative development tools
allowed easier porting of GNUish software to COHERENT. At MWC we used
the GNU development tools to improve the system include files and
overall code quality. However, no MWC production bits were build
with GNU compilers, this always was done with MWC's development tools.
<br>
<br>
<br>

<a name="comeau"></a>
<p><b><font size="5">Comeau C++ compiler:</font></b></p>
In 1994 Comeau Computing contacted MWC about providing Comeau C++ 3.0
for COHERENT 4.2. There were various difficulties with the MWC development
tools, header files and libraries, which interfered with this compiler.
Because of my experiences with integration of the GNU development tools
into COHERENT I was assigned the task to work on solutions with
Greg Comeau and Steve Ness. I was very interested in getting this
working, Comeau licensed Cfront 3.0 from AT&T and their compiler
was based on Cfront, so the real full C++ implementation with templates.
We got all problems solved and eventually Comeau C++ 3.0 was made
available for COHERENT 4.2 by Comeau Computing.
<p>
This compiler is not just a C++ compiler, it uses the native UNIX C
compiler as backend and also unprotoizes ANSI C before feeding the
compiler backend. It also includes a very strict code analyzer, which
won't just check the prototypes, but generates much more warnings
about questionable programming similiar to lint.
<p>
IMHO this compiler was the best avaliable option at the time, not
only for COHERENT, but for other such systems as well. On systems
with this compiler installed you'll have:
<ul>
<li>A traditional K&R C compiler</li>
<li>A C89 ANSI C compiler</li>
<li>A AT&T compatible C++ compiler with templates</li>
<li>Strict syntax checking similar to lint</li>
</ul>
On many systems, including COHERENT, lint was an additional
product, not included in the base system.

<a name="floatingpoint"></a>
<p><b><font size="5">Floating point support:</font></b></p>
The Intel 8086, 80186, 80286 and 80386 do not contain a FPU for
floating point calculations, the 80486DX was Intel's first
processor with CPU and FPU on a single die. For CPU's before
an additional FPU 8087, 80287, 80387 was available and many
PC motherboards had a socket for it. Unfortunately
such a FPU, working with the same clock frequency as the CPU,
was even more expensive than the CPU. Many private users
did not get a FPU for their system because of this, they
would be used only in automatization projects, when the
additional costs for the FPU were justified with much faster
floating point processing.
<p>
The early COHERENT 8086 and 80286 distributions intended for
end users don't require a FPU, the C compiler generates code
that computes floating point with the CPU. For Intel and other
OEM's a compiler and runtime libraries can be generated that use FPU
instructions to accelerate floating point calculations.
<p>
This changed with COHERENT release 4.0 because it also was targeted
for small business usage, so it had to support a FPU if available.
For this the compiler got an option -VNDP to generate code using
the 8087 FPU, without the option it generates code processing
floating point calculations with the CPU, same as releases before.
Also runtime libraries using floating point calculations were build
in two versions. The ones in /lib and /usr/lib use software floating
point, the ones in /lib/ndp and /usr/lib/ndp were compiled with
the option -VNDP using FPU instructions. This also enabled any
third party to build libraries with support for a FPU, and another
one doing floating point calculations with software.
<p>
For whatever reason the GNU compilers did not support software floating
point, for the 386 target (and others as well) it generates code that
requires a FPU. Instead of fixing this people used a feature in the
386 CPU, if the FPU is absent it generates an interrupt which can be
trapped, and then the floating point calculation the FPU was asked to
do is done with software. This solution is inferior because it needs
context switches from the user program into the kernel FPU emulation,
and then back to the user program, which is much slower than have the
compiler directly generate code doing software floating point math.
Anyway, MWC also implemented such an FPU emulation as optional kernel
module, so that anyone without FPU was able to use the GNU compilers
on such a system.
<p>
Mixing object modules that include FPU instructions with software floating
point code will not work of course. The MWC/RTR X11 libraries for some
reason include references to the software floating point routines, which
is unnecessary because X11R5 doesn't do any floating point math. The result
of this are link errors, if one compiles X11 applications with the GNU
compilers. If the application won't do floating point calculations one
can temporarily move /usr/lib/libc.a into /usr/lib/ndp to resolve the
linking errors, but this won't work with applications doing floating
point math. This is why I wrote that you cannot build ghostscript
your self just from sources, this requires additional manual work at the
object level, which cannot be automated well with make.
<p>
Problems like this likely are caused by usage of the compiler/linker
option -f, which forces linkage of printf() functions with support
for floating point. If any library really needs to be build with the -f option
two versions should be build and not just only one.

<a name="features"></a>
<p><b><font size="5">Compilation Environments and Feature Tests:</font></b></p>
The following was written by MWC documentation guru Fred Butzen.
I can't write it any better, so I'm using Fred's text here. Please note
that this describes the latest MWC compiler version as distributed with
the 4.2.x systems, earlier versions of the C language compiler environment
won't have all of these features implemented.
<p>
The COHERENT  header files are  designed to let  you invoke any  of several
``compilation environments''.  Each environment offers its own features; in
this way,  you can easily  import code that  conforms to the  POSIX or ANSI
standards, compile device drivers, or otherwise fine tune how your programs
are compiled.   To invoke a  given compilation environment, you  must set a
feature test.
<p>
As discussed  in the Lexicon article name space,  the ISO Standard reserves
for  the  implementation   every  identifier  that  begins  with  a  single
underscore followed  by an upper-case  letter.  The POSIX  Standards define
several  symbols in  this name  space  that the  implementation can  use as
``feature tests''  -- that is, as  symbols that you can  use in your source
code  to determine  the  presence or  absence  of a  particular feature  or
combination  of  features.   Note   that  a  feature  test  applies  to  an
implementation of  C, rather than  to an operating system.   A feature test
combines aspects of the host system and the language translator: some tests
apply to the operating system, some purely to the C translator.
<p>
The  operating  system's   header  files  can  define  them  (for  example,
_POSIX_SAVED_IDS)  to control  compilation  of user  code or  to deal  with
optional  features,  or  you can  define  them  (e.g., _POSIX_C_SOURCE)  to
control how  the system's header files declare  or define constants, types,
structures, and macros.
<p>
In general,  a feature  test must  either be undefined  or have  an integer
value.  It must not be defined  as having no expansion text, or expand into
a string.  For example,
<pre>
	# CORRECT
	cc -D_POSIX_C_SOURCE=1 foo.c
</pre>
is correct, as is:
<pre>
	# CORRECT
	cc -U_POSIX_C_SOURCE foo.c
</pre>
However,
<pre>
	# WRONG
	cc -D_POSIX_C_SOURCE foo.c
</pre>
is incorrect, as is:
<pre>
	# WRONG
	cc -D_POSIX_C_SOURCE="yes" foo.c
</pre>
This is to permit the constants to be tested with expressions like
<pre>
	#if _POSIX_C_SOURCE > 1
</pre>
where an integer  value is required.  (If the symbol  is used in a #if test
and is  undefined, cpp  replaces it  with zero, which  is still  an integer
value).  This  permits the  implementation to  use different values  of the
feature test  to invoke different  feature sets; and  it simplifies testing
for complex combinations of feature tests.
<p>
Although nearly  all feature tests behave  as shown above, there  are a few
exceptions, namely _POSIX_SOURCE and _KERNEL. These symbols are not defined
as having a  specific value, so many users do  not supply a value.  To deal
with this,  the COHERENT  header files  check whether these  constants have
expansion text.  If they do  not, the header files redefine these constants
with value  1, so that they  can be used like the  other feature tests that
the COHERENT header files define.
<p>
The  following describes  the  feature tests  used in  the COHERENT  header
files,  and briefly  describes  the compilation  environment each  invokes.
Because we are continually adding new  features to the kernel, this list is
not guaranteed to be complete.
<p>
<b><font size="4">_DDI_DKI</font></b><br>
Invoke the environment for compiling device drivers.  This environment
makes visible  all DDI/DKI  function prototypes and  data definitions,
and defines  all fundamental data types and  structures as mandated by
UNIX System V, Release 4.
<br>
Please note  that this feature  test is an COHERENT  extension, and is
not portable to other operating systems.
<p>
<b><font size="4">_KERNEL</font></b><br>
Invoke the  environment for compiling  the kernel or  a device driver.
This  environment gives  code full access  to system's  private header
files.  Under COHERENT, this option is equivalent to defining _DDI_DKI
to value  1, because COHERENT  only supports compiling  DDI/DKI driver
source code from System V, Release 4.  This means that the definitions
of many fundamental data types such as pid_t are changed to the System
V,  Release  4  definitions  rather  than  the  System  V,  Release  3
definitions used by user code.  (This is a System V convention.)
<p>
<b><font size="4">_POSIX_SOURCE</font></b><br>
<b><font size="4">_POSIX_C_SOURCE</font></b><br>
Select  a  ``clean'' compilation  environment,  in  which the  headers
defined in  the POSIX.1 or  POSIX.2 standards define  no symbols other
than   the   ones   that   those   environments   require.    Defining
_POSIX_C_SOURCE  with  value 1  selects  the  POSIX.1 environment,  as
defined in the  POSIX.1 standard.  Defining _POSIX_C_SOURCE with value
2 selects the POSIX.2 environment, as defined in the POSIX.2 standard.
Defining _POSIX_SOURCE has the same effect as defining _POSIX_C_SOURCE
with value 1.
<p>
<b><font size="4">_STDC_SOURCE</font></b><br>
Select a ``clean''  compilation environment.  In this environment, the
headers that the ANSI C  standard defines define no symbols other than
those that  the standard requires.   This feature test  is designed to
let you compile  conforming Standard C programs that themselves define
functions or macros that the COHERENT header files defined in addition
to those described in the ANSI standard.
<br>
Please note  that this feature  test is an COHERENT  extension, and is
not portable to other operating systems.
<p>
<b><font size="4">_SUPPRESS_BSD_DEFINITIONS</font></b><br>
This feature test  invokes a compilation environment that excludes all
definitions that  are included  for compatibility with  Berkeley UNIX.
As of  this writing,  this feature test  affects only the  header file
<string.h>, and prevents it from defining the macros bcopy(), bzero(),
index(),  and rindex().  Note  that selecting  a POSIX  or Standard  C
environment also suppresses these definitions.
<br>
Please note  that this feature  test is an COHERENT  extension, and is
not portable to other operating systems.
<p>
<b><font size="4">_SYSV3</font></b><br>
This  feature test  invokes  a compilation  environment  in which  all
fundamental types and data structures have the definitions mandated by
UNIX System V, Release 3.
<p>
<b><font size="4">_SYSV4</font></b><br>
This  feature test  invokes  a compilation  environment  in which  all
fundamental types and data structures have the definitions mandated by
UNIX  System V,  Release  4.  As  of  this writing,  this facility  is
incomplete and used mainly to develop device drivers and extensions to
the kernel.
<br>
Please note  that this feature  test is an COHERENT  extension, and is
not portable to other operating systems.
